     Welcome to the Jazz Pianist Volume 2.

You should install these disks to the same directory as your
existing Jazz Pianist Volume 1 files. This is usually c:\JAZZPIAN.
If installing both Volumes at the same time, Volume 2 should be installed
AFTER Volume 1.

     There is lots of on-line Help available 
        ( press F1 at any time in the program to access HELP )

Note: There are 2 features that are not documented in the manual. 
1. You can advance the piece in step time a chord at a time by 
using the Ins and Del keys on the Numeric Keypad. 
Ins moves back a chord, Del moves ahead by a chord
2. There is a notation button on the screen. Pressing it will 
display the notation - see the Notation Window for more 
documentation on this feature.


If for some reason the installation program doesn't work from Windows,
you can install the files from DOS instead. In this case, install
the program using INSTDOS.BAT which uses the utility program DUNPACK.EXE
to manually decompress the files.
     Have Fun !
