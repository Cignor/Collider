\Roy Brown
\Tommy Ridgley
\Fats Domino
\*Dave Bartholomew

He learned arranging in the army during WWII.
<3

\Tommy Ridgley
\Eddie Gorman
\*Roy Brown
\Larry Darnell
^Roy Brown, the first real singer of soul music, recorded it in 1947 on De Luxe with the Bob Ogden band, although it didn't make the R & B charts until the following year, when Wynonie Harris had covered the tune, cashing in on its popularity.  But Brown's success did focus national attention on the budding New Orleans R & B sound.  Brown left New Orleans in 1949 when he got popular (as so many others did), but his popularity had peaked nationwide by 1950.  Gorman and Darnell were Brown's replacements in Paul Gayten's band.
<3

@012 What was the name of Fats Domino's first hit?
\"I'm Walkin"
\*"The Fat Man"
\"Blueberry Hill"
\"Ain't That a Shame"
^"The Fat Man".  Dave Bartholomew produced it on the new Imperial label in 1950, supplying the musicians for the band.  Bartholomew felt the mix was bad—the piano and saxes were too loud—and regretted he had to be in the control room rather than playing trumpet in front of a mike, but the sound caught on, sold the record, and made Domino easy to remember. It reached a million sales by 1953.  His next three releases were flops.
<3

@013 What was the pianistic trademark of Fats Domino's style?
\Lots of glissandos
\Broken-octave boogie bass
\A characteristic blues lick using parallel thirds
\*Incessant triplet chords
^ Incessant triplet chords, although Domino did not originate this figure.  He got it from a 1948 recording by Little Willie Littlefield: "It's Midnight" on the Modern label.  Once he embraced the figure he had to keep it as a trademark, reigning in his own inventiveness as a pianist, according to Bartholomew.
<3

@014 "I Hear You Knocking" was a 1955 hit by Gale Storm (of My Little Margie fame).  What New Orleans artist was she covering?
\Huey "Piano" Smith
\Tommy Ridgley
\Fats Domino
\*Smiley Lewis
^Guitarist/Vocalist, Smiley Lewis had put it out earlier that year on Imperial, produced by Dave Bartholomew.  Lewis was never a great success, despite Imperial's hard pushing. He was a commanding and versatile entertainer, able to scat and sing horn parts, and equally at home in Dixieland and bebop.  Another of his songs, "One Night (of sin)" was covered in a watered down version by Elvis as "One Night (of love)" in 1958.
<3

@015 With what tune did the 17-year old Lloyd Price first break into the charts?
\*Lawdy Miss Clawdy
\Ain't It a Shame
\Stagger Lee
\Personality
^Lawdy Miss Clawdy was recorded on Specialty Records in May 1952 by Hollywood label owner Art Rupe on a trip to New Orleans.  He was just about to give up when the young Price wailed the song to him and sold him.  He took Price to Matassa's studio, got Fats Domino to play piano and Dave Bartholomew to hire the band and produced the first cross-over release in R & B history.  Henceforth the music sold as big to white audiences as to African-American ones. (All the other answers are Lloyd Price recordings, from 1953, 1958 and 1959 respectively).
<3

@016 "Let the Good Times Roll" is one of the mottos of New Orleans.  Who recorded the song in 1956?
\Sugar Boy Crawford
\*Shirley and Lee
\Papa Lightfoot
\Lloyd Price
^Shirley Goodman and Leonard Lee gave Aladdin Records their first million seller with this hit.  They had first attracted attention at ages 14 and 15 respectively with "I'm Gone," recorded at Matassa's by 30 neighborhood kids, each one putting up 5¢ to cut the $2 demo, in which they were the standouts.  They broke up in 1963.
<3

@017 "Jocomo Feenanay" also known as "Iko Iko" is a Mardi Gras anthem, recorded by the Dixie Cups and Dr. John.  Who first released it?
\Tommy Ridgley
\The Hawketts
\Ernie K-Doe
\*Sugar Boy Crawford
^James "Sugar Boy" Crawford, who had a very popular local rock band, the Cane Cutters, released it in 1953 on Chess, a label out of Chicago.  Crawford never received the fame many think he deserved.  His grand nephew, pianist/vocalist Davell Crawford, is active on the local R & B scene in New Orleans today.
<3

@018 The mambo craze had swept the US in the late forties and was largely responsible for opening New York clubs to integrated audiences for the first time.  Who recorded the 1954 hit "Mardi Gras Mambo," which remains a perennial of the Mardi Gras season in New Orleans?
\Tommy Ridgley
\*The Hawketts
\Ernie K-Doe
\Sugar Boy Crawford.
^The Hawketts were founded by Art Neville, currently of the Neville Brothers.  This locally, very popular nine-piece group, recorded the tune for Chess Records, a Chicago based, R & B oriented label.  This was their only recording.  At the same time the group was popular Ray Charles was in New Orleans for an extended period absorbing the local style.  He sometimes sat in with the group. 
<3

@019 What did the word "jazz" originally come from?
\An African word for rhythm
\No one knows
\The famous singer Jasmine Jones
\*A sexual reference.
^A sexual reference from "jasm", a corruption of the word "orgasm."  See also "boogie-woogie" and "juke" as in juke box, juke joint.  The original spelling of jazz was "jass." The word "jazz" first appeared in print in the San Francisco Bulletin in 1913, referring pejoratively to the performance of an army band. It was first applied in print to New Orleans music in 1915—in Chicago, referring to Tom Brown's band.  Brown embraced the term, calling his group "Brown's Dixieland Jass Band."
<3

\Banjo
^Stringed bass.  He also played tuba. Foster played with the Olympia Brass Band and the Eagle Band (with Kid Ory) until World War I.  He worked with big bands during the 20's and 30's, especially Louis Armstrong's, and was very widely recorded.  He joined Earl Hines in California in the early 50s.
<3

@022 Louis Armstrong first came to prominence under what band leader?
\Freddie Keppard
\Kid Ory

\Freddie Keppard's Original Creole Orchestra
\King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band
\*Nick LaRocca's Original Dixieland Band

^Nick LaRocca's Original Dixieland Band in 1917 on Columbia.  The tunes were the "Dixie Jazz Band One-Step" (later called the "Original Dixieland One-Step") and the novelty "Livery Stable Blues" featuring barnyard calls.  Keppard had been given the chance to record two years earlier, but turned it down out of fear of being copied.  Ironically, this meant the first jazz group on record were white. 
<3

@024 Eddie Jones of Greenwood, Mississippi recorded the smash hit "The Things That I Used to Do" in December 1953 on Specialty Records.  It became a million seller.  What was the name that Jones recorded it under?
\Elmore James
\Ike Turner
\*Guitar Slim
\Gatemouth Brown
^Guitar Slim replaced Lloyd Price at Specialty when the latter was drafted.  "The Things That I Used to" was such a success that Elmore James and Ike Turner both recorded similar spin-off tunes—"Sho 'Nuff I Do" and "The Way You Treat Me."  Slim followed it up strongly with "The Story of My Life," then went to the west coast, but never duplicated his first successes, dying in 1952 at age 32.
<3

\Henry Butler
\Eddie Bo
\David Torkanowsky
\*James Booker
^James Booker.  "Little Booker" went on to great success as a rather idiosyncratic New Orleans style pianist, more acclaimed in Europe than in his home town.  He later taught piano prodigy Harry Connick, Jr., at the instigation of Connick's father, the New Orleans district attorney, a lifelong jazz fan.  He died at the tragically young age of 44 in 1983, having spent time in prison.
<3

@026 What was the song that skyrocketed Little Richard to fame in early 1956?
\*Tutti Frutti
\Ready Teady
\Good Golly Miss Molly
\Keep a Knockin'
^ Tutti Frutti was recorded almost as an afterthought.  The only rock 'n' roll tune at the end of an R & B session, it sold 500,000 for Imperial and was covered successfully by both Pat Boone and Elvis.  Little Richard immediately followed it up with the successful "Long Tall Sally," and later recorded the other choices in this question. 
<3

@027 What R & B artist made successful recordings of standards "I'm in Love Again," "My Blue Heaven," and "When My Dreamboat Comes Home" in 1956?
\Bobby Charles
\*Fats Domino
\Art Neville
\Clarence "Frogman" Henry
^Fats Domino sold nearly two million with "I'm in Love Again" (on Imperial), which reached no. 5 on the Billboard chart.  Fats and others recorded standards because the booking agencies thought the rock 'n' roll craze would be over soon.  Fats chose "Blueberry Hill" as a standard, and it became his trademark (selling 3.5 million).  Dave Bartholomew was his producer throughout this time.
<3

@028 Who was the first non-African-American successfully to record a New Orleans R & B release?
\*Bobby Charles
\Jerry Byrne
\Frankie Ford
\Ricky Nelson
^Bobby Charles was born, Robert Charles Guidry in Abbeville, LA in 1938.  He had a local hit with "Later Alligator," adapted from Guitar Slim's "Later for You Baby," later covered by Bill Haley as "See You Later, Alligator."  Charles shined more as a balladeer ("On Bended Knee,"  "Why Did You Leave," "Why Can't You") and especially as a song writer, having penned "But I Do" for Frogman Henry and "Walking to New Orleans" for Fats Domino.
<3

@029 Independent record labels had been responsible for getting the New Orleans R & B sound out to the world and shepherding its transformation into rock 'n' roll.  Why did this independent recording activity die out in New Orleans in the mid-50s, leaving the city without an important recording industry, despite the abundance of talent and originality there?
\Recording could be done more cheaply elsewhere
\the Mafia moved in and ruined the scene
\the major labels bought out the profitable independents and forced the others out of business
\* recording in New Orleans was always on a shoestring and couldn't keep up with technological improvements elsewhere
^Recording in New Orleans was always on a shoestring and couldn't keep up with technological improvements elsewhere.  The musicians' union kept session prices up, while imitators of the New Orleans sound did sessions below scale for major companies in larger cities.  And it was difficult for the local labels to afford new equipment.
<3

@030 What collective role did saxophonists Alvin "Red" Tyler and Lee Allen, guitarist Ernest McLean, drummer Earl Palmer, pianist Ed Frank, and bassist Frank Fields play in New Orleans R & B recording in the 50s?
\They were Fats Domino's sidemen
\They all moved to New Orleans to participate in the music at that time
\They were Dave Bartholomew's de facto studio band for many classic recordings
\*They supplied backup vocals for the R & B singing stars
 ^They supplied backup vocals for the R & B singing stars.  Although accused of being a clique, they were simply the most requested musicians for the sessions, able to tailor their sounds to the individual artists.  Under Tyler's leadership they created arrangements on the wing, never written down, and were never paid for them.
<3

@031 What was the name of the legendary club where New Orleans musicians hung out, jammed, held court and wrote music during the 50s?
\Tyler's
\*The Dew Drop Inn
\Club 544

<2

@032 What was the main difficulty encountered by New Orleans bands in their circuits through the south?
\bad food
\bad transportation and slow roads
\dishonest booking agents
\*racism
^Racism.  In Slidell, Bogalosa and Lacomb, LA black bands had to play behind a curtain to white audiences.  The musicians were often threatened or derided.  In some places they were given leftovers to eat.  When times were good they avoided these gigs.

<1

@034 How long would a hit record last on a juke box in the 50s before it had to be replaced by a fresh copy?
\three days
\*one week
\a month
\about four months
^One week in most locations.  Hits had to be replaced weekly, since the vinyl was of poor quality and the playback heads heavy (4 oz.).  They'd average 100-110 plays in a week's time and they were garbage.
<2

@035 "Those Lonely Lonely Nights," a blues ballad, was Ace record's first big hit.  The artist's name was Solomon Johnson, but his public knew him by another name, what was it?
\Dr. John
\Johnny Solomon.
\*Earl King.
\Franz Schubert
^Earl King.  Although Franz Schubert did compose a setting for Goethe's poem "The Earl King." King came up doing gospel, and cut this record in 1955.  It took him three years to get away from the sound, which became the basis later on for the Louisiana swamp-pop style.
<2

@036 In 1924, a year after joining King Oliver in Chicago, Louis Armstrong married the band's pianist.  What was her name?

\*Lil Hardin
\Mary Lou Williams

\Dippermouth Blues
\*West End Blues
\Livery Stable Blues
\Muskrat Ramble
^West End Blues.  Prior to that time solos were mainly rhythmically based or simply embellishments of the melody.  Armstrong created an entirely new melody to the chord changes, and this has been the character of jazz improvisation ever since.
<2

@038 What pianist followed quickly in Armstrong's footsteps, abandoning the ragtime style of piano solos and playing single line solos "like a horn player."
\Jelly Roll Morton
\James P. Johnson
\Willie "The Lion" Smith

\Drug dealing
\alcohol consumption
\gambling
\*prostitution

^ Prostitution.  Storyville, the notorious red light district, was not the bonanza to musicians many have imagined it was.  It provided work mainly for pianists, who frequently performed behind screens in the more elaborate houses, while wealthy patrons inspected "the goods" in the salons, whose furnishings were paid for with "revolving" credit and perpetual promises to pay next month. 
<1

\Luis Russell
\*Jelly Roll Morton

\*Buddy Bolden
\Freddie Keppard
\Bunk Johnson 
\Papa Celestin
^ Buddy Bolden (1868-1931) was frequently compared to a shepherd calling his sheep.  He went berserk in 1907 and was confined to a mental institution thereafter.  Morton immortalized him in "Buddy Bolden's Blues."  Lincoln Park is now the site of Chevron station on Carrollton Avenue.

\reed trumpet
\*soprano saxophone
\French horn
\"C" melody saxophone
^Soprano saxaphone.  Bechet switched to soprano sax in 1919 when he moved to New York from Chicago.  John Coltrane later followed Bechet's example.  Although he never gave up the tenor sax, he recorded his famous version of "My Favorite Things" on the instrument.  The soprano sax  has played a major role in modern jazz ever since.

<1

@050 Jazz was not the only music in New Orleans in the early part of this century, society orchestras, like the famous one led by John Robichaux, flourished in the "Tango Belt," which stretched across the downtown area.  What was the main difference between these groups and the jazz bands?
\*Society orchestras read all their parts, while jazz bands played from memory or improvised

\Society orchestras played in private venues, while jazz band played in public clubs
\Society orchestras were always paid, while jazz bands mostly played for drinks and tips

\He became involved with disreputable promoters who swindled him
\His health declined

@064 In 1938 Jelly Roll Morton, while in Washington, D.C. managing and playing in a sleazy night club, he spent five weeks recording verbal reminiscences and piano performances at the Library of Congress.  Who had taken the initiative to record this invaluable oral history?

\*Alan Lomax
\Gunther Schuller

\Paul Whiteman
\King Oliver
^W. C. Handy.  The truculent Morton had little respect for the Memphis-based Handy.  He thought Handy's claims to have invented the blues, completely overblown, and said so in an infamous letter to Down Beat in 1939.  Morton claimed to have invented jazz himself in 1902.

<2

@089 This artist, who composes, produces and performs, was first discovered by saxophonist Red Tyler during a talent search for Minit Records in the early 60s.  He was offered an album deal, but he did not have enough material completed, so they all worked on his song ideas.  They recorded them and sent them to New York, most without titles.

\Boogie Jake
\Ernie K-Doe
\*Jesse Hill
\Ben Spellman
^Jesse Hill.  When Hill got a $2000 advance from Minit, after having tried to sell the song to Joe Ruffino of Ric and Ron Records for $35, he didn't know what to do with it.

\*Chris Kenner

@099 In 1961 Harold Battiste formed A. F. O.—All For One—from his and Allen Toussaint's studio band, including saxmen Red Tyler and Nat Perrilliat, drummer James Black, Eddie Bo, Melvin Lastie, and vocalist Tammi Lynn, on the theory that the musicians should be playing for a percentage of the success of a record, not simply for a flat studio fee, while a featured artist would make thousands.   They had two hits: Barbara George's "I Know" and Willie Tee's "Always Accused."  They put out one contemporary jazz album, "Monkey Puzzle," but the project soon failed.  Why?
\corrupt management
\*lack of good distribution
\weak material
\the musicians scattered
^Lack of good distribution was the perennial problem, but the group also tended to be more interested in modern jazz, since the musicians themselves were determining what to record.  Although the project failed, it produced an important document in New Orleans contemporary jazz of that period, including the first studio recording of Ellis Marsalis, and the only contemporary jazz recordings of Nat Perrilliat, who died in 1972, and who is still revered by his fellow musicians.
