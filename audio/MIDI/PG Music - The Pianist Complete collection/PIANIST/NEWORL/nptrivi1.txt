@100 In 1961 Bobby Robinson, owner of Fire and Fury records in New York heard a New Orleans artist who sounded to him like Ray Charles.  He flew down to New Orleans, found the artist at home, but with no material.  Then he heard children singing on the porch swing: "Sittin' on the la la, yeah, yeah," and it stuck in his mind.  He drove the artist uptown to a bar, where they worked out the lyrics  "Sittin' here la la, waitin' for my ya ya"  in 15 minutes over beers.  The next day they sang it into a tape recorder  and got Harold Battiste to arrange the tune.  The song was called "Ya Ya."  Who was the artist?

\*It was an organ instrumental
\It used synthesizer overdubs
\It has Harry Connick, Jr. playing drums in the background

\They loved him in France, but were cool in England
\*They were cool to him in France but loved him in England

<1

@107 The great era of New Orleans R & B was over by 1964.  Why?
\*The Beatles invasion changed the nature of rock music
\Big companies had swallowed up the smaller labels
\New Orleans musicians turned away from R & B towards contemporary jazz
\Too many people had copied the style
^Rock music began to be played with much more elaborate equipment setups; horns were replaced by guitars, and groups were managed and produced more professionally.  The heroic age was over.
<1

@108 In 1964 three high school girls from New Orleans calling themselves the Dixie Cups put out a song on Jerry Lieber and Mike Stoller's New York label Red Bird which hit number one on the charts.  It was pure pop, nothing New Orleans about it.  What was the tune?
\Down Home Girl
\*Chapel of Love

\pressing
\*mixing
\equalizing
\trimming
^Mixing.  This was single track recording, direct to disc, where you had to blow away the plasting tailings at the needle cut into the acetate.

<1

\the II7 chord
\the III7 chord
\*the IV7 chord

\the Medieval church modes
\early 19th century French music

\a mainly-for-tourists street celebration
\a fascinating practice now discontinued

<1

@158 What is the most important skill for a Mardi Gras Indian?
\keeping good rhythm

\Grandpa's Spells
\*The Fingerbreaker
\The Pearls
\King Porter Stomp.

\Grandpa's Spells

What was the tune called?

\"Junco Partner"
\"Chain Gang"
