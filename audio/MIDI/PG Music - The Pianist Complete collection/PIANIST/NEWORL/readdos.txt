You have now installed The Program.
This has copied the program files to the directory 
that you've chosen.

********************************************************
To finish installation from DOS, you need to 
1. copy the font 
files PGMUSIC.TTF and PGTEXT.TTF to your Windows System
directory eg.  c:\windows\system
2. (If you're upgrading a previous version of the program
and are using virus TSR scanning software (eg VSAFE.SYS from CPAV and DOS 6)
then delete the c:\bb\smartchk.cps or c:\chklist.ms file. Otherwise
you'll get a message about "file size has changed (due to the upgraded
program being a different size than the old one)
3.When you run Windows, you'll need to install the program into
your program manager group by :
     - choosing File\New\Program item
     - typing the program name
     - the program icon will then appear and you can
       mouse click on it to start the program !
