@130 Which of the following celestial rags is by James Scott ?
\Stardust rag
\the Meteor March
\*Sunburst Rag
\Man in the moon rag
^One of Scott's best and a gem of the classic Ragtime repertory, it
foretells the rise of Novelty style playing with its pianistic devices.
Published in 1909 it was also accompanied by his classic Grace and Beauty. 
John Arpin recorded it on 'The Other Side of Ragtime 'for Scroll records in
April 1966.
<2
@131 Which of the following Scott rag has the title of a traveler ?
\Trouble maker rag
\Minstrel man rag
\Gypsie heart rag
\*Troubadour rag
^As Scott matured his piano scores became increasingly intricate both
rhythmically and harmonically, so much so as to challenge the abilities
of pianists in any idiom.A heavy textured rag typical of Scott's later
years, the Troubadour includes beautiful articulations of variations of
his familiar devices. John Arpin recorded it on 'The Other Side of Ragtime'
for Scroll records in 1966.
<2
@132 Which of the following is the only classic rag in D flat and G flat ?
\*Excelsior rag
\Ragtime Oriole
\Quality rag
\Hilarity rag
^An oustanding piece by master Ragman Joseph Lamb, its use of intricate
 rhythmic forms and rich harmonies demonstrate another facet of Lamb's
 genius. Known for his landmark experiments with structure, Lamb decided
 to use the classic form inherited from Joplin to show off his other
 attributes. It was recorded by John Arpin on 'The Other Side of Ragtime'
 for Scroll records in 1966.
<3
@133 What rag named after a state was written by Joe Lamb ?
\While in Chicago
\Michigan water
\*Alaskan rag
\A Tennessee Jubilee
^Probably Lamb's most intricate rag in the classic form it is an
extension of the earlier complexity shown in his previous rags.  
John Arpin recorded it on 'The Other Side of Ragtime' for Scroll
records in 1966.
<2
@134 Who wrote Bird-Brain Rag ?
\*Joe Lamb
\Tony Jackson
\Fats Waller
\Abe Holzmann
^In the classic form Bird-Brain is thinner in texture to allow for a 
more widespread melody. It also employs tenths in the bass in the
C and D sections as opposed to octaves. From the Ragtime Treasures
collection, it is one of thirteen pieces that Lamb started writing
in his prime that was never published. However because of the 
encouragement of Rudi Blesh and Harriet Janis ,authors of 
'They all Played ragtime' Joe Lamb decided to finish his
fragmentary works as well as to compose new pieces. This unique 
collection posthumously published in 1964 gave us the opportunity to
see Ragtime as conceived by one of its masters within a larger
framework. John Arpin recorded it on 'Concert in Ragtime' for
Scroll records in 1965.  
<3
@135 Who wrote Sleepy Hollow Rag ?
\Tom Turpin
\*Clarence Woods
\Louis Chauvin
\Scott Hayden
^Referring to a black community outside of Carthage it is as unusual
as it is expressive. The A section is written around a tremolo 
that reoccurs in the second C section and the B section employs 
light fills over a sustained chord. John Arpin recorded it on
'Concert in Ragtime' for Scroll records in 1965.
<3
@136 Which one of the following Rags has the same name as a famous
basketball player ?
\Irving's rag
\Buzzer rag
\Volcanic rag
\*none of the above
^The Meadow Lark rag (Meadowlark Lemon) written by Tom Pitts
was published in 1916. It deviates from the classic form by returning
to the A and B sections in the end. It is considered the most subtle 
and delicate of the bird-call rags. It was recorded by John Arpin
on 'The other Side of Ragtime' for Scroll records in 1966.  
<2
@137 Who was Charlotte Blake ?
\*a Ragtime pianist
\Arthur Marshall's influential first wife
\a Ragtime critic
\none of the above
^One of the outstanding woman composers of the Ragtime era her
Pickles and Peppers became very popular throughout the United 
States. It is considered definitive Ragtime by many pianists.
Live wires rag, Wireless rag and Victory March are her other
published works.
<2
@138 Who is sometimes called the father of 'Stride' piano.
\Abba Labba
\Willie 'the Lion' Smith
\*James P.Johnson
\Fats Waller
^A close relative of Ragtime, Stride piano flourished in Harlem
and the Eastern regions. Influenced by the Rags of Joplin, the 
southern Negro cotillion and set dances, as well as from the 
European concert tradition it was widely heard in New York in 
the twenties. From 1916-30 James P.Johnson was the outstanding 
Ragtime pianist in New York and it was at this time that he 
developed the 'Stride' style of playing.
<2
@139 Who was James P.Johnson's most famous pupil ?
\Jelly Roll Morton
\*Fats Waller
\Eubie Blake
\Glover Compton
^The most well-known of the stride pianists, Waller was taught
the tricks of the trade by Johnson himself. Simplifying and
lightening up Johnson's style allowed Waller to capture the 
public's attention and make 'stride' popular through his exuberance
and entertaining personality.
<2
@140 Which of the following composers wrote show music, movie scores
and symphonic works ?
\Scott Joplin
\Louis Chauvin
\Tom Turpin
\*James P.Johnson
^An incredibly versatile musician Johnson not only wrote large
works of an orchestral nature but is also considered the 'Father
of the stride piano' style. Unfortunately many of his larger works 
have never been done justice because of the inherent rhythmic
complexity of the orchestral parts. The rhythmic sensitivity 
required to play his larger pieces is something that the modern
orchestra regrettably lacks. 
<3
@141 The New York scene developed differently in what way ?
\*it developed an orchestral style
\its tempo slowed down
\it developed a lighter approach
\it incorporated multi-cultural music
^Characteristic of the New York sound were full, round, widespread
chords and tenths. The European concert pianists playing all over
the city at the time set the standard for what New York audiences
expected to here, thus the Ragtime's and Stride piano players
adopted many classical techniques in order to get a fuller sound.
<2
@142 What was one of the main differences between A New York rag
and one from Saint Louis ?
\*tenths and thirds
\Saint Louis preferred rags in minor keys
\New York rags were generally slower
\Saint Louis composers were experimenting with chord extensions
^Due to the European influence the New York Ragtime piano scene developed
an orchestral quality about it. In Saint Louis many pianists were
content to play thirds in unison while the New York pianists played
tenths. Another important difference was the tempo at which the eastern
pianists played. Breakneck speeds were common in the Eastern regions.  
<2
@143 What New York pianist could accomplish a 14th interval stretch ?
\George Gershwin
\James P.Johnson
\*Luckey Roberts
\Ben Harney
^According to James P.Johnson, Luckey Roberts possessed a hand stretch
that was out of this world. In the Guinness book of world records the 
title for largest hand stretch goes to classical great Sergei Rachmaninov
who had a stretch of a 12th. Roberts beats Sergie by two intervals. ouch!  
<3
@144 Who was Ben Harney ?
\a Ragtime revivalist
\*the inventor of Ragtime
\Fats Waller's publisher
\a  black classical pianist from New York
^It is uncertain whether the white, 25 year old Harney invented Ragtime 
or not, however his first publication in 1895 of 'You've Been a Good Old 
Wagon but You've Done Broke Down' contain the first examples of rudimentary 
Ragtime in print.
<2
@145 Who was H.Krell ?
\*the first to have a Ragtime piece published
\a ragtime publisher
\owner of QRS the largest piano roll company
\Scott Joplin's teacher
^Bandleader W.H.Krell was the first musician to have a true Ragtime piece
published. Published in 1897 his 'Mississippi rag' was the first example
of Instrumental Ragtime in print. The early date of publication gives
us a good indication that rural folk Ragtime pre-dated its popularity
by several years. In fact Krells band had been performing the piece for
a time before it was published.
<2
@146 Who was Abba Labba ?
\*a pupil of Luckey Roberts
\a vaudeville entertainer
\an anti-Ragtime minister
\the owner of the popular Rosebud club
^A famous New York pianist, James P.Johnson was highly influenced by
him, as he indicates in the following : "Abba Labba had a beautiful left 
hand and did wonderful bass work. He played with half tone and quarter 
tone changes that were new ideas then. He would run octaves in chords, 
and one of his tricks was to play 'Good Night, Beloved, Good Night' in  
schottishe, waltz and ragtime. I fell on his style and copied a lot of it."  
<3
@147 Why was Willie 'the Lion' Smith called 'the Lion' ?
\his playing was unbelievably aggressive
\he had the bad reputation of getting into bar room brawls
\he was simply a tremendous player
\*none of the above
^Smith was certainly a tremendous player however it was as a sergeant
in France during World War 1 that he became 'the Lion'. Along with James.P
Johnson and Fats Waller, 'the Lion' was one of Ragtime's and Strides 
central figures in Harlem.
<3
@148 Who was Paul Seminole ?
\Scott James' friend and business partner
\a composer of Tin Pan Alley hits
\*an awe inspiring pianist
\Joplin's boyhood friend who became one of the first Black men in Politics
^Part Indian and from Florida Seminole was one those musicians in a class
by himself. He played for no other reason but for playing's sake with no
interest in selling numbers or publication. To impress he played the guitar
with the left hand and the piano with the right. The greatest musicians
of the time still remember him with awe. 
<3
@149 Who was Donald Lambert ?
\a Texas bandleader
\Scott Hayden's famous literary relative
\the main distributor of piano music in the country in the twenties
\*Paul Seminole's partner
^Like Paul Seminole, Lambert was a truly awe inspiring player who didn't
care for wealth or fame. One of his and Seminole's specialties consisted
of playing two melodies in simultaneous counterpoint and often in different
keys, while in constant harmony. A part of the game was to allow the 
listener to choose the melody.
<3
@150 What Ragtime pianist did a show with Gershwin in London in 1922 ?
\James Scott
\*James P.Johnson
\Eubie Blake
\Tom Turpin
^Both musicians being interested in elevating blues ideas to a higher
level, they exchanged many ideas concerning their ambitions to do great
music on American themes. They met at the Aeolian piano roll company where
Gershwin was cutting oriental numbers.
<2
@151 Who was the first black man to cut piano rolls of his own music ?
\Eubie Blake
\*James P.Johnson
\Fats Waller
\Luckey Roberts
^Of the many accomplishments that Johnson racked up this is definitely
one of the most important. Many piano rolls of rags by some of the most
important black Ragtime composers were recorded by white pianists before 
this time, and for no other reason than discrimination.  
<2
@152 Who wrote they all played Ragtime ?
\James P.Johnson
\Donald Lambert
\*Rudi Blesh and Harriet Janis
\Max Morath and Ralph Sutton
^Ragtime historian Rudi Blesh's contribution to Ragtime is hard to 
 measure. 'They all played Ragtime' written with close friend Harriet
 Janis was the first history of Ragtime and set off waves of 
 enthusiasm about the music. It even prompted composer Joseph Lamb
 into a new creative phase.    
<2
@153 Scott Joplin's 'Guest of Honor' has been... ?
\acclaimed as brilliant and innovative
\*lost 
\performed many times since Joplin's death
\copied and altered
^One of the mysteries surrounding the life of Scott Joplin, it was 
lost and never recovered, despite the fact that there exists records  
at the copyright office in Washington. The Ragtime opera was performed
once in St.Louis but met with little success, much to the 
disappointment of Joplin.
<2
@154 Who is Max Morath ?
\*a Ragtime revivalist
\a bandleader of a popular Chicago Ragtime orchestra in the twenties
\the author of 'They all played Ragtime'
\an one of the leading anti-Ragtime's
^One of the important figures in the Ragtime revival of the sixties,
Morath wrote and performed two series for the series for National
Education Television between 1959 and 1962 : 'The Ragtime Era' and 
'Turn of the Century'. He also toured the nation with his one man
shows promoting Ragtime and recorded over a dozen albums for various
record labels.  
<2
@155 How many of the Maple Leaf rag's 80 measures are syncopated ?
\75
\51
\70
\*67
^The Maple Leaf became the standard by which rags were gauged.
  Many composers including Joseph Lamb and James Scott studied
 and employed its many devices in their own work, as did just about
 every other composer. One of its main features that made it the
 model for real Ragtime was of course its syncopation. 
<3
@156 Ragtime's distinctive syncopation is characterized by ... ?
\accents on the 1st and 3rd eighth note
\accents on the 3rd eighth note
\*accents on the 2nd eighth, or 3rd or 4th 16th note  
\none of the above
^Definitely its most enduring attribute Ragtime's syncopation
was originally viewed as a device becoming only non-serious music. 
It was also seen as a bad influence on young minds. It originated with 
the off balance rhythms of the black banjo players and eventually 
found its way to the piano. These syncopations were extremely
influential in shaping the music that followed and continues to do so
today.
<3
@157 Pick the most appropriate answer. Ragtime is a product of ... ?
\*socio-musical syncretism
\West African dances
\Baroque music
\American jigs
^The fact that the rhythmic patterns inherent in ragtime existed
in Baroque music, American jigs and certain West African dances
supports the belief that ragtime came about by a blending of 
various cultures.  
<2
@158 Which of the following is characteristic of a Ragtime melody ?
\the occasional use of atonal lines
\use of the whole tone scale
\*its wide range
\its frequent use of the blues scale
^Often encompassing a three octave range the Ragtime melody is
sometimes divided into upper and lower soprano sections. 'Call
and response' type of dialogue takes place by tossing around short
melodic fragments from lower to upper. These elements combine to form
the unique contour of a Ragtime melody. 
<3
@159 Which of the following devices serves to reinforce the feeling
 of syncopation in Ragtime ?
\*tremoloed octaves
\glissando
\chromatic playing
\use of the damper pedal
^Also used to highlight parts of the melody through embellishment, 
 tremoloing octaves is an identifying characteristic of the Ragtime
 era. The rhythmic, percussive quality of the tremolo has also
 contributed to the enhancement of its unique syncopation. This can
 best be demonstrated by using octave tremolo while playing in 
 another style and observing the almost magnetic pull towards a 
 Ragtime feel.
<2
@160 What Ragtime device is almost orchestral in nature ?
\the oom-pah bass
\glissandos
\*a counterline against the main melody
\drum like solo breaks i.e. Luckey Roberts playing
^While an argument could be made for any one of the answers above,
 Ragtime's occasional use of the counterline best mimics by function
 the role of melodic support of the orchestra. Although subtle, the
 use of the counterline often gives the illusion of larger proportion 
 to a piano rag. 
<3
@161 What is considered a rare occurrence in Ragtime ?
\the use of pentatonic scales
\*the melody in the bass
\the use of chord extensions
\steady dynamic flow
^Typical Ragtime is characterized by the melody in the soprano
 register, however there are occasional examples to be found of the
 melody in the bass. The third strain of Joseph Lamb's 'Ethiopia rag'
 with the accompaniment in the soprano is a good is one.  
<2
@162 Short, temporary modulations occur ... in a rag ?
\*frequently
\infrequently
\only in slow sections
\none of the above
^Rags are generally divided harmonically into two main areas :
the tonic and subdominant. Temporary modulations to the related
keys within these areas is common. Dissonance is provided by
non-chord tones however the chords used possess conventional interval
structure.  
<3
@163 Which of the following is not a common Ragtime chord ?
\*thirteenth 
\secondary dominant seventh
\diminished seventh
\Augmented sixth
^The thirteenth chord was not yet part of the pianist's bag of
tricks, however in addition to the above three were triads, ninth
chords, and triads with the added sixth.
<2
@164 What does Ragtime have in common with Mozart and Haydn ?
\the similar use of octave tremolo
\Mozart's memoirs speak of his toying with what could be called rag
\the use of backhanded glissandos
\*chord syntax
^The way the chords are connected is no different than in works
by the classical composers. Consistently the roots of the chords 
follow the three standard diatonic progressions :up a fifth or down
a fourth, down a third ,and up a second.
<2
@165 Ragtime resembles barbershop harmony in what way ?
\its apparent simplicity
\its use of harmonic embellishment
\*its chromatic progressions
\the range that it takes place within
^In the most original rags the use of chromatic progressions 
 was a common staple. Interspersed between strong diatonic harmony
 secondary dominants and diminished sevenths chords are common. 
 The D strain of James Scott's masterpiece 'Grace and Beauty'
 demonstrates the use of chromatacism perfectly.  
<2
@166 Most strains in a piano rag ... ?
\*repeat before the next begin
\are 20 bars in length
\are 8 bars in length
\repeat after all strains are played through once
^The classic structure of a rag is commonly given as ABACD, however
 this is a simplification of AA BB A CC DD which is the accurate
 version of the structure of a classic rag. With the exception
 of the third A section all the strains repeat consecutively. The
 A section of a rag usually contains its main theme, and thus restates
 itself after the B section in order to launch the rag into the C-D
 sections which are in the sub-dominant key.       
<2
@167 A strain in a piano rag is almost always... ?
\32 bars long
\8 bars long
\*16 bars long
\20 bars long
^This standard length is occasionally separated by introductions
 and transitions of four bars in length. Since the strains repeat
 the end result is 32 consecutive bars of each. However unlike Jazz
 which made this the standard form, after inheriting it from Ragtime,
 in a rag the strains are contained 16 bar parts which are simply 
 repeated, not unlike some music from the Baroque period. Jazz music
 with its looser, improvisational style adopted the package but
 varied the contents, in that through consistent variations on the 
 theme within 16 bars, jazz eventually developed longer statements
 that encompassed the whole 32. 
<2
@168 In piano rag form the last sections(C-D) usually... ?
\end in the tonic key
\end in the subdominant key
\*all of the above
\none of the above
^It must be pointed out that the method of analysis varies and that
although both of these answers are correct the more common way of 
interpreting a rag is to view it as a tonic (A&B strains) to 
subdominant (C&D strains) harmonic structure. Two other ways of 
looking at a rag are from Tonic-Tonic(a perfect 4th apart) and from
Dominant-Tonic. The first concedes a functionally equal relationship 
between the AB sections and the CD sections which is not always 
present, while the second is simply backwards. Which method to use 
depends on the individual rag.    
<3
@169 Introductions and transitions in a piano rag are usually... ?
\2 bars long
\*4 bars long
\8 bars long
\indeterminate lengths
^Occurring in the beginning of the AB sections and the CD sections
 respectively, the introductions and transitions rarely vary in 
 length. It is somewhat common to find a transition section between
 the C and D sections as well. 
<2
@170 Which composer was able to transcend Ragtime's usual four measure
     phrase ?
\*Joe Lamb
\Donald Lambert
\Wally Rose
\Johnny Maddox
^One of Joe Lamb's major contributions to Ragtime ,it was but another
 fashion in which he could manipulate the various elements at his 
 disposal. Good examples of it can be heard in the first strains of 
 'American Beauty', 'Top Liner' and 'Arctic Sunset'.
