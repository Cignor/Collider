\Jelly Roll Morton
\Glover Compton
^One of the most popular pieces of the day, it was considered the best
that Ragtime had to offer by some, while a marked digression by others.

<2
@063 What was Treemonisha ?
\a group of Ragtime enthusiasts
\a manual of Ragtime techniques
\*Joplin's second opera
\the name given Ragtime's musical lineage
^One of Joplin's most consuming works, this opera in three acts and
230 pages was copyrighted and published by Joplin himself at his own 
expense in 1911. It received one poorly inadequate performance
in Harlem hall in 1915 with Joplin himself playing the orchestral parts
on the piano. The failure of this piece dealt a severe blow to Joplin's

<2
@065 In what year did Scott Joplin die ?
\1915
\*1917
\1920
\1918
^It is only fitting that Ragtime's greatest composer's death marks 
the end of the era. However the assumption that his death was the cause 
of its end is a false one. Many factors played a role in the end of Ragtime,
such as Joplin's own adherence to an idealistic style of Ragtime, which
opened the door to the looser form of Jazz, and the abuse that Ragtime
endured at the hands of the Tin Pan Alley practitioners. 
<2

    'Ragtime' ?
\*Stravinsky

eleven instruments including a French horn and a cimbalom (the Hungarian
national instrument. 
<3
@067 A revival in Rag piano occurred ... ?
\in the mid 70's
\in the 60's
\in the early 40's
\*all of the above
^A testament to its worth, Ragtime not only influenced everything from
country to classical to jazz, but decided it needed to be heard in its true 
form on several occasions since its heyday. The historian and author
of 'They all played Ragtime', Rudi Blesh, the Ragtime entertainer Max Morath 
and the conductor-arranger-scholar Gunther Shuller are three of the leading 
revivalists. The 1974 movie 'the Sting' also prompted a revival of Ragtime 
on records.  
<2
@068 Who was Jelly Roll Morton ?
\Publisher-Promoter
\*Ragtime influenced Jazz pianist
\a vaudeville singer
\a Ragtime arranger
^Considering himself a Jazz musician first, Morton's playing marks
the period of transition between Ragtime and Jazz. His style owed a great
deal to Ragtime as he loved it and understood it, and could illustrate
the difference between classic Ragtime and his deviations from it into Jazz.
<2
@069 What Actor-Comedian shares his name with a rag written by
Eubie Blake ?
\Smokey Mokes
\Lovie Joe
\Hitchy-Koo
\*none of the above 
^Published in 1914 Blake's 'Chevy Chase' rag had to undergo simplification
 in order to be published. Eubie himself sums up the reasoning behind this
 by saying, "We were advised we had to write for the girl in the 
 five-and-ten -cent store." Meaning that the sale of a rag piece would
 depend on whether the sales clerk could play it convincingly enough to the 
 stores customers. 
<3
@070 The Ragtime era came to an end by what year ?
\1925
\*1920
\1915
\1930

and publication were virtually non-existent at this time.  
<2
@071 Who wrote the 'Pastime Rag' ?
\*Artie Matthews
\Joseph Lamb
\Scott Joplin
\Tom Turpin

rags or rags in the Saint Louis style. 
<3
@072 Who was Tom Turpin ?
\James Scott's mentor
\important Ragtime publisher
\Ragtime piano roll manufacturer
\*composer of the 'Harlem rag'
^Considered to be one of the top five leading Ragtime composers, Turpin
helped usher in the era with The Harlem rag published in 1897. He also
authored many other important works such as 'The Bowery Buck' and
'St.Louis rag'.
<2
@073 How did a typical Ragtime pianist's left hand support the song ?
\alternating oom-pah with strait chords
\*with an oom-pah bass
\strait chords
\alternating bass octaves with strait chords
^The time keeping oom-pah bass is precisely what the pioneers of Ragtime
sought to discard during Ragtime's experimental years. Joplin and his
colleagues were trying to make the inherent Rhythm less explicit in the form, however even though none of them ever completely achieved
this goal their efforts yielded positive results. Mimicking the right 
hand, and interspersing short single note lines are just two of the  
approaches conceived.
<2
@074 What distinguished Jelly Roll Morton's versions of the Maple Leaf rag
as Jazz rather than Ragtime ? 
\his swing
\his comping patterns with the left hand
\*his hitting the left hand a 16th note early
\he dropped the oom-pah bass
^Coming from the Ragtime school Morton's departures from it led to his
creation of his own early jazz style. Although very similar to Ragtime
Jelly Roll's Jazz was looser. Ironically, it represented to the public
the same sense of rhythmic freedom that Ragtime had twenty years earlier. 
<2
@075 The majority of Joplin's rags are structured in what way ?
\*ABACD
\ABCD
\ABCDE
\ABACDA
^This widely used classic form in four strains was made popular by Joplin. Many leading Ragtime composers used the form however a notable
exception is Joseph Lamb whose experiments with structure led to new ground within the genre.    
<3
@076 Joplin's use of prosody in his 'Magnetic rag' is evident through
the use of which technique ?
\octave tremolo
\*dominant preparation
\glissandos
\chromatic chord motion
^This classical technique of harping on and around the dominant of the
 key which is to be restored, is particularly effective in achieving 
what's implied by the piece's title.
<3
@077 What piece by Artie Matthews became widely used in Jazz ?
\*Weary Blues
\Pastime rag # 2
\Pastime rag # 5
\Wise Old Moon
^Matthews' Weary Blues was published in the same year that he decided
to leave Saint Louis and get out of Ragtime. Weary Blues went on to become 
a classic of the Blues repertory while Matthews went on to become a teacher
of classical music.   
<2
@078 Who was Louis Chauvin ?
\*a Ragtime piano virtuoso
\Joseph Lamb's publisher
\a French Classical composer
\a great Chicago bandleader
^Possibly the greatest of all the Ragtime pianists Chauvin's virtuosity had
no rivals. Unfortunately most of Chauvin's brilliance has been lost due to the
fact that he couldn't write music. Only three of his pieces were published
and no phonograph recordings were ever made.
<2
@079 Who wrote 'Bill Bailey, won't you please come home' ?
\Irving Berlin
\*Hughie Cannon
\Sam Patterson
\William Turk

together with John Queen formed the successful song and dance team of
Queen and Cannon.
<3
@080 Scott Joplin's 'Chrysanthemum' was a product of his ... ?
\first attempts at Ragtime
\efforts to achieve commercial success
\*World's fair period
\experimental years
^In 1904 Joplin published three heavy rags that possess a light syncopation
unlike any Ragtime heard before. All three 'Chrysanthemum', 'the Favorite'
and 'The Sycamore' have a triumphant ring ; probably inspired by the World's
fair bustle.
<3
@081 Who wrote 'Frog legs rag' ?
\Charles Hunter
\Max Morath
\*James Scott
\Arthur Marshall
^Published in 1906 'Frog Legs rag' is in classic Ragtime form, except
that it possesses a straightforward ragtime theme in the A section
and a soaring B theme which is typical of Scott's brilliance. In 
contrast most classic rags such as Joplin's 'Maple leaf rag' provide the main
theme in the A section.
<3
@082 Ragtime inherited its rhythm from what instrument ?
\*the banjo 
\the guitar
\the hand drum
\African harps
^Possessing what Music critic Rupert Hughes called 'banjo figurations'
the rhythm of Ragtime developed from the banjo and its predecessors.
The percussive playing style of the black banjo players eventually found its
way to the piano.
<2
@083 What Irony is inherent in Irving Berlin's 'Alexander's Ragtime band' ?
\it helped to sell more instrumental rags than it sold itself
\*it is virtually non-syncopated
\it was written about Melford Alexandre who was himself poor
\none of the above
^One of the most popular songs from the period it used the Ragtime
title as a marketing gimmick as many other pieces did. However as
great a tune as it is, it isn't Ragtime in the sense that we use the
term today, as it's syncopation is not nearly as distinctive as that of the
Ragtime forms of the day. 
<2
@084 Classical music had an influence on which of the following
 Ragtime pianist's ?
\Tom Turpin
\Scott Joplin
\James Scott
\*all of the above 
^Just as many classical composers incorporated Ragtime into their
music so did the Ragtime composers employ many classical devices
into Ragtime's Rhythmically intricate fabric. From a compositional
point of view this is particularly interesting, as it suggests that
the Ragtimers used a bottom-up (rhythm as a base) approach as opposed 
to the top-down infusion method used by the classical composers.
<2
@085 What were called 'crazy chords' by musicians in the Ragtime era ?
\13th chords
\*cluster chords
\full ten finger chords
\very large voiced chords used by pianists such as Luckey Roberts
^Although most Ragtime used traditional European harmony the experiments
of the classical composers such as Charles Ives were paid close attention
to, and vice-versa.
<3
@086 What important Ragtime composer devoted the last 30 years of his
life to the classics ?
\*Artie Matthews
\James Scott
\Eubie Blake
\Tom Turpin
^Matthews was one of ragtime's best trained and musically educated
composers. During his early years in Saint Louis he was active as a composer
and arranger turning out entire shows, including orchestrations, once a week.
<2
@087 He would hardly allow talk of Ragtime in his presence, who was he ?
\Clarence Woods
\James P.Johnson
\*Artie Matthews 
\Charles.L.Johnson
^One of the leading composers of the Ragtime era, Matthews abandoned
Ragtime the same year in which his classic Blues piece 'Weary Blues'
was published. He went on to start his own classical conservatory where
for a period he downplayed his association with Ragtime. His 'Pastime rags',
no's 1-5, remain important contributions to the Ragtime repertoire.
<2
@088 What was the difference between pure Ragtime and early Jazz ?
\*pure Ragtime was a notated form, Jazz was not notated
\Ragtime used conventional harmony, Jazz didn't
\Ragtime frequently employed octave tremolo, Jazz didn't
\all of the above
^In the early Jazz styles the use of conventional harmony and octave
tremolo were still in wide use. The main differences between Jazz and
Ragtime were that Ragtime was essentially fixed(not improvised)and 
more or less played the same way each time, where as Jazz was improvised
and played differently each time. Also early Jazz was primarily an un-notated
music as mentioned above, and was looser rhythmically than Ragtime.   
<2
@089 What did Jelly Roll Morton and James Europe have in common ?
\*they were both accomplished sight readers and improvisers
\neither musician was influenced by classical music
\they were both banjo enthusiasts
\none of the above
^Both musicians were among the few Jazz musicians that could read and 
improvise. They both considered themselves Jazz musicians however they 
originally came from Ragtime. Their knowledge of classical music was
also quite considerable.
<2
@090 What was the difference between a New York rag and one from
Saint Louis ?
\major differences in use of harmony
\New York Ragtime dropped octave tremolos
\*speed 
\Saint Louis rags were generally in a minor mode
^The 'Saint Louis' style as it was sometimes called implied
 "not-to-be-played-fast" Ragtime. In contrast the Eastern Ragtime
possessed a stronger rhythmic drive as in Eubie Blake's classic
'Charleston rag'.   
<2
@091 Which one of the following pieces by Eubie Blake was known as a
fingerbuster ?  
\Manda
\Shuffle along
\Fizz Water
\*Charleston rag 
^A good example of Eastern Ragtime it is a virtuoso instrumental piece.
It incorporates a tricky walking bass in the A strain with loose feel.
It is also a good representation of the transition from Ragtime to early 
Jazz.
<2
@092 What was at once partially responsible for bringing Ragtime
to a close and also preserving it ?
\Religion
\the American Federation of Musicians
\*Jazz music 
\country music
^The freer more spontaneous form of Jazz received a reaction similar to
that of Ragtime when it initially appeared on the scene, in that its
provocative feel was very attractive and its allure made any previously
known form seem pale by comparison. The idea of 'Jazzing up' a tune can 
draw a parallel with the former 'ragging' of a tune, and thus when Jazz
inherited Ragtime it took with it all of Ragtime's assets as they were 
viewed at the time, providing us with an indication of its former glory.  
<2
@093 Who was Mike Bernard ?
 'the Ragtime King of the World'
\the main Ragtime pianist on disc before the 20's
\a  white classically trained Ragtime pianist
\*all of the above
^Cylinder recordings and phonographs recordings of solo piano were 
scarcely made during the Ragtime era, however the main pianist on disc
until the 20's was Mike Bernard. A child prodigy trained on the classics
Bernard's opportunism led him to Ragtime. Designated 
'the Ragtime King of the World' by largely white audiences he was the first
of the pseudo-Ragmen, brilliantly emulating Ragtime but never capturing its 
true essence. 
<2
@094 What was the best selling piano roll of a Ragtime piece ?
\Temptation rag
\The Entertainer
\*Dill Pickles rag by Charles L.Johnson 
\Black and white rag
^Piano roll companies would use any type of music that was popular.
Of the piano rags 'Dill Pickles' was the best seller, being issued
by at least ten different companies. 'At a Georgia Camp meeting' and
'the Maple Leaf rag' were also best-sellers.
<2
@095 What type of embellishments were added on to piano rolls ?
\*double the bass and treble
\Jazz fills
\the bending of notes
\all of the above
^A few more piano roll embellishments were the extensive use of the tremolo
and short fill-in runs. The most popular was the mid-range melody in tremolo
with flashy playing in the higher range. Another technique used to create
a subtle strumming type effect was to cut one bass note out of the first
octave played of the oom-pah bass part. This characteristic was typical
of piano rolls made by the Connorized company.
<2
@096 Who said that Ragtime was characteristic of our "thoughtless
superficial optimism" ?
\Theodore Thomas
\*Daniel Gregory Mason
\Hiram K.Moderwell
\Walter Damrosch
^The foremost of the anti-Ragtimers, Mason was adamantly opposed to 
Ragtime and its possible consequences. His fanatical attitude led him
to believe and say that he thought the 'jerk and rattle'of Ragtime to
be ugly' and that it was 'a caricature with the vitality of a comic strip. 
<3
@097 Many anti-Ragtimers believed that the popular music was... ?
\demonic
\satanic music
\to be avoided like the black death 
\*all of the above
^Ragtime enjoys the company of many other great art forms in its
initial persecution. However unlike many others its circumstances prompted
attacks on many different levels : religious, social, sexual, racial, etc.
The mere fact that Religious institutions made Ragtime a concern is a
testament to its importance.   
<2
@098 Who said that Ragtime caused brain damage ?
\*Francis Toye
\Gustav Kuhl
\Max Weber
\Canon Newboldt
^Another anti-Ragtimer Toye tried to gain acceptance for his belief that
 listening to Ragtime would 'eventually stagnate the brain cells and wreck
 the nervous system'. He even went so far as to cite 'scientific' data to
 this effect.
<2
@099 Which of the following contributed to Ragtime's controversy ?
\widespread bigotry
\sexual connotations
\moral indignation
\*all of the above 
^Ragtime endured all types of attack but the issue causing it the most
damage was that of racial discrimination. Many brilliant composers and
musicians were denied opportunities on this basis, a fact that makes
all other disputes seem ridiculous.
<2
@100 Who was 'the King of the Ragtime writers' ?
\Mike Bernard
\*Scott Joplin
\Porter King
\Jack Diamond
^Mike Bernard went by 'the Ragtime King of the World', Jack Diamond's
real name was Bert King, and from Porter King and Jelly Roll Morton
we get the 'King Porter Stomp', but only Joplin could truly lay claim
to his given title of 'the King of the Ragtime writers' 
<2
@101 Joplin's most popular rag was named after a ... ?
\*a club
\a small town
\a fruit
\none of the above
^The 'Maple Leaf rag', the most popular rag of all times, was named
after the much frequented club of the same name in Sedalia. An important
center of political and social activity in Sedalia, it was here that John
Stark Joplin's future publisher first heard him play. 
<3
@102 In what city did Scott Joplin first achieve success ?
\New York
\Saint Louis
\*Sedalia
\Chicago
^It has been suggested that when Joplin played the Maple Leaf rag 
for John Stark in his Sedalia office, he brought a little boy
along with him to dance to the tune. This helped sway Stark into
publishing the piece. In any event Joplin and Stark signed a five
year contract which eventually brought Joplin worldwide fame.
<2
@103 Who wrote Smokey Mokes?
\*Abe Holzmann
\Willy the Lion smith
\Jay Roberts
\May Aufderheide
^One of the most popular rags on Piano rolls it was also a favorite
on banjo and in larger settings. 
<3
@104 What was Scott Joplin's rag manual called ?
\'Ragtime Method'
\'Ragtime studies'
\*the 'School of Ragtime'
\'Learn to play Ragtime'
^Published by John Stark in 1908, Joplin's preface to it read : 
"What is scurrilously called ragtime is an invention that is here to stay. 
That is now conceded by all classes of musicians. That all publications
masquerading under the name of ragtime are not the genuine article will
be better known when these exercises are studied. That real ragtime of 
the higher class is rather difficult to play is a painful truth which 
most pianists have discovered. Syncopations are no indication of light
or trashy music, and to shy bricks at 'hateful ragtime' no longer passes
for musical culture.To assist amateur players in giving the 'Joplin Rags'
that weird and intoxicating effect intended by the composer is the object
of this work."
<3
@105 Included in many of Joplin's publications is a note which
indicates ... ?
\*not to play this piece fast
\must be played fast
\to play lightly
\to play aggressively
^Proper ragtime playing according to Scott Joplin was never supposed to
 be played fast. In contrast many New York pianist's rags epitomized 
 flashy, speedy playing.
<2
@106 Scott Joplin was friend with which of the following composers ?
\Arthur Marshall
\Scott Hayden
\Joseph Lamb
\*all of the above
^Joplin's natural drive was to work for the music he loved, not only
through his own efforts but by assisting other talents.
<2
@107 How did Scott Joplin die ?
\dementia paralytica-cerebral
\syphilis
\*all of the above
\none of the above
^After the failure of his opera Treemonisha in 1915 Joplin suffered
a complete breakdown. In the fall of 1916 he was committed to the Manhattan
State Hospital where he died on April 1,1917. 
<2
@108 What important pianist swept the floors of a music store on his
way up ?
\Joseph Lamb
\*James Scott
\Scott Joplin
\Eubie Blake
^Working for Dumars' music company the 16 year old Scott swept floors 
until the owner Charles Dumars heard him play. Scott was soon promoted
to sales clerk and song demonstrator. Recognizing Scott's genius Dumars
started a publishing division in March 1903 with Scott's 'A Summer
Breeze : March and Two-step. 
<3
@109 Which one of the following Ragtime composers possessed a developed sense
of perfect pitch ?
\*James Scott
\Joseph Lamb
\Scott Joplin
\Tony Jackson
^Scott's perfect pitch was so comprehensive that even as a child he
could distinguish full chords and repeat them back at will.
However only did he have an extremely developed sense of pitch but 
it has been rumored that he was ambidextrous as well.
<3
@110 Who was dubbed 'the little perfessor' ?
\Eubie Blake
\Brun Campbell
\*James Scott
\Percy Wenrich
^Slight in stature Scott gained the title of the little perfessor
from his colleagues. He also acquired the title of 'The Crown Prince
of Ragtime'.
<2
@111 The inner strains of a rag are... ?
\longer than the first and last strains
\generally more interesting
\*symmetrical
\seemingly disjointed
^Although square by nature the inner parts of a rag are original
 and forward thinking given tonal considerations. Looking at a rag
 harmonically as a tonic-tonic  structure(AB-CD), this becomes more
 evident, as the second tonic section is at a higher key level than
 the first. This innovation is made all the more remarkable when 
 considering that Ragtime employs conventional European harmony 
 and a fairly rigid part structure.   
<2
@112 Who said "We were advised in those days to write for the girl
     in the five-and-dime store" ?
\Roy Bargy
\Zez Confrey
\Charles Warfield
\*Eubie Blake
^Referring to the trend of simplifying rags for public consumption
 Blake sums up what the climate was really like with this sentiment.
 For the Eastern Ragtime's this fact of life was all the more obvious,
 as their brand of Ragtime grew more and more complex the public's
 taste thirsted for the watered down versions. Unfortunately even
 if the public's taste had wanted the original versions the method
 by which these pieces could have been heard didn't exist, as
 recordings of rags were only made if the piece became popular and 
 that was truly in the hands of the dime store girl.   
<3
@113 Which way of harmonically analyzing a rag is correct ?
\tonic-subdominant
\dominant-tonic
\tonic-tonic
\*all of the above
^It must be pointed out that the method of analysis varies and that
although all of these answers are correct the more common way of 
interpreting a rag is to view it as a tonic (A&B strains) to 
subdominant (C&D strains) harmonic structure. Two other ways of 
looking at a rag are from Tonic-Tonic(a perfect 4th apart) and from
Dominant-Tonic. The first concedes a functionally equal relationship 
between the AB sections and the CD sections which is not always 
present, while the second is simply backwards. Which method to use 
depends on the individual rag.    
<3
@114 The C-D strains of a rag are usually... ?
\*a trio
\symmetrical
\shorter than the A and B sections
\none of the above
^An interesting feature of rag form is that the trio which usually
 occurs in the C and D sections begins and ends in another key. In 
 traditional forms containing a trio, the A strain returns whereas
 in some Ragtime it does not. There is no doubt that Ragtime composers 
 were aware of circular ternary structure in music before Ragtime,
 as many examples point to this fact. Rather it was an adventurous
 compositional leap that brought about this development in Ragtime.
<3
@115 Who was the first to use the term 'hot' in relation to African
     rhythms ?
\John Stark
\Ted Shapiro
\*Richard A.Waterman
\Joseph W.Stern
^The concept of 'hot' to African rhythms found in the New World, originated 
 with a paper written by Waterman. It was read at the ninth annual meeting
 of the American Musicological Society in New York City on December 28th,
 1943. The idea was subsequently adopted by American society. 
<3
@116 Which of the following is a recurring rhythmic motif in Ragtime ?
\8th note - 16th note - 8th note
\*16th note - 8th note - 16th note
\half note - 16th note - half note
\whole note - 8th note
^This rhythmic motif was used so many times that it became a cliche. It
 was used in many of the first Major rags of the era and consequently
 was jumped on by imitators. It became an indicator of formula writing
 and lack of originality on the composer's part. Only when re-visited
 with the intention of expanding on it did this motif yield any fresh
 material in the later Ragtime years.
<3
@117 What was 'Kitten on the keys' ?
\an expression meaning 'unpredictable'
\a popular Joplin piece for three pianos, it was simplified for piano roll
\a virtuostic ragtime masterpiece
\*a novelty piece
^Written by Zez Confrey, a conservatory trained classical pianist who
turned to ragtime, it was actually inspired by the composer's pet kitten
walking across the keys. Hugely successful, it marked the inception of 
the Novelty piano style. The novelty style being very pianistic, lightly
poked fun at ragtime by incorporating concert piano embellishments.
<2
@118 Ragtime generally does not...?
\incorporate cultural influences
\use introductions
\*employ mixed meters
\use chromatic harmony
^Strongly influenced by western dance music Ragtime's duple meter is 
 consistent. It does however make use of bass lines that give the illusion
 of 3/4 time by placing an accent on the first beat and weaker accents on
 the second half of the first beat and on the second beat. The only
 exception to using the duple meter is found in Ragtime waltzes which use
 a 3/4 meter proper.
<2
@119 Who wrote 'Grace and Beauty' ?
\*James Scott
\Scott Joplin
\Tony Jackson
\Clarence Woods
^Many authorities agree that 'Grace and Beauty' is Scott's finest rag.
 John Stark also had much regard for it describing it as "heavy", 
 "high class", and "A rag as it ought to be". He also admonished his 
 customers, "Play every note of Grace and Beauty in slow march time and
 there is no person with soul so dead as not to like it."
<2
@120 What does Joplin's 'Magnetic rag' and 'Euphonic Sounds' have
     in common ?  
\they were both written in the same year
\*the left hand plays more than oom-pah
\they both use forward and backward simultaneous glissandos
\they both share the same theme
^During Joplin's later experimental years he sought, to weaken the 
stronghold that the oom-pah bass had on Ragtime. He only accomplished
this in a minor fashion having never achieved a full blown unified style 
that he was after. He was not alone in this goal as many Ragtime's and 
Jazzmen have sought to downplay the explicit beat while maintaining rhythmic 
momentum. It is interesting to note that there is no universally accepted
technique of achieving this end in music. A fact which perhaps points
out the importance of Rhythm in music, and our lack of understanding of it.
<2
@121 When Jazz inherited ragtime what did it leave behind ?
\a reliance on diatonic harmony
\the oom-pah bass
\*form
\all of the above
^Seeking one theme as a center for improvisation the Jazz musicians 
weakened the sense of form that it originally took from Ragtime. This 
is ironic in that at the same time that early Jazz with its looser form was
emerging, Scott Joplin was writing music that solidified form in ragtime. 
While improving Ragtime, this also contributed to its demise as the public
wanted to here a less structured music that was again ironically implied
by Ragtime's syncopation.  
<2
@122 What is Scott Joplin's most Ambitious rag ?
\Solace
\Euphonic Sounds
\Pastime rag
\*Magnetic rag
^The third theme (C section) of the Magnetic rag is Joplin's only
successful attempt at breaking the 16 bar barrier. This unique Joplin rag 
points to sonata form, as well as employing the tonic minor in the D
section rather than the relative minor as is customary. Another attribute
that it boasts is the use of dominant preparation which involves moving to 
and around the dominant of the key that is to be restored. Considering its
title, this technique creates the subtle effect of harmonic prosody .      
<2
@123 Which of the following Joplin rags is in Rondo form ?
\Maple Leaf rag
\American Beauty rag
\*Euphonic Sounds
\Original rags
^The study of Euphonic Sounds reveals the heights that Joplin attained
during his later, experimental years. Cast in Rondo form (ABACA) its 
principle theme is repeated three times with the B and C sections in 
between. Its use of contrast between the themes is outstanding and further
contrast is provided by the internal structure of the themes. Euphonic
Sounds is also rich in its use of dynamics as well.   
<3
@124 What musical problem was Joplin not able to overcome ?
\breaking the 16 bar barrier
\*making rhythmic momentum implicit
\using chromatic harmony the way he envisioned
\achieving a balanced form that would rival classical structure
^The goal of making the Ragtime oom-pah bass an implicit factor of the
 music rather than an explicit one, was common among Ragtime composers.  
 No one composer achieved this in any significant manner, however Joplin,
  and Lamb all had small successes in this area. The best examples of
 this to be found in Joplin's music are in his 'Euphonic Sounds' and his
 'Magnetic rag'. 
<2
@125 How did Joplin attempt to maintain rhythmic momentum without
     explicit delineation ?
\*with straight chords and arpeggios
\using tenths moving by single quarter notes
\by playing the melody in the bass and comping with the right hand
\none of the above
^The straight chords of the trios in 'Paragon' and the arpeggios in
 'Euphonic Sounds' are good examples of the attempts made by Joplin
 to deal with this problem. However they left much to be desired, in fact
 the other solutions mentioned in the question above were also not 
 conclusive. They were conceived by Joseph Lamb who finished work on them
 in the 60's. This seems to indicate that the explicit Rhythm of Ragtime
 doesn't appreciate being tampered with.  
<3
@126 How could a listener tell that Joplin studied Beethoven ?
\he ragged some of his motifs and incorporated them into his own music
\*He always approached keys through its dominant
\his use of dynamics is similar
\Many of his early rags use variations on Beethoven's sonatas
^It was a well known fact that Joplin was an avid student of the
 classical masters, employing classical structures as well as European
 harmony in his work. Beethoven's influence on him is indisputable as 
 aspects of Joplin's music contain devices that originated with Beethoven.
 A good example of the above 'Beethovian' device in Joplin's music can be
 found in the second theme of his 'Euphonic Sounds'.  
<2
@127 In what year did Joplin start his experimentation
\1905
\1911
\*1909
\1914
^Joplin's experimental years never came to their fruition by the time
he died in 1917. His many ideas began to cover new territory which he
alone was equipped to explore, as the younger musicians were more 
interested in Jazz and not the disciplines of Ragtime. In retrospect
Joplin's years after 1909 yielded many important innovations which
influenced much music that followed.
<3
@128 What Ragtime composer synthesized the styles of Scott Joplin and
     James Scott ?
\Paul Seminole
\Jack Diamond
\Porter King
\*Joseph Lamb
^Joe Lamb's initial exposure to Ragtime was almost exclusively limited
 to written music. Unbelievable as this might seem when considering his
 stature as one of the three major Ragtime figures, it allowed him the 
 opportunity for in-depth study of the most important works of his
 colleagues. Of course Lamb's music was not limited by the above mentioned 
 synthesis, his ability to manipulate diverse elements created many unique
 rags.
<2

@129 Joseph Lamb employed diverse textures in his work, this is best
     exemplified by his... ?
\piano rags and orchestral Ragtime pieces
\*light and heavy rags
\transition to jazz
\Tin Pan alley hits
^One of Lamb's major contributions to Ragtime was his ability to mix
diverse textures, and as mentioned above this is most evident when
comparing his light rags to his heavy rags. However the extent of this
talent goes far beyond the differences between rags, as Lamb was able to
create tremendous diversity between strains and even phrases as well.
