@787 Beethoven's Piano Sonata in F minor, Op.2, No.1 was composed in 1795 and first published by Artaria of Vienna in 1796. It is dedicated to Joseph Haydn, Beethoven's former teacher, along with Op.2, Nos.2 and 3. All of the Op.2 have four movements, a rarity in 18th century sonatas. The F minor sonata has a light texture which is similar to Haydn, however, its dramatic character and bold use of dynamics are clearly the product of Beethoven's fiery temperament. The first movement Allegro displays these sharp dynamic contrasts, which must have been shocking to listeners at the time. Beethoven's first eleven piano sonatas, until Op.22, are often classified as coming from his First Period of composition in which Beethoven roughly conforms to the classical traditions of Haydn and Mozart.

@791 The opening motif of the Allegro Vivace first movement of Beethoven's Piano Sonata in A, Op.2, No.2 creates humor, vigor and energy from very few notes. It is just a hint of the complexity and scale which Beethoven finds in this wonderful work. 

This sonata is far grander than Op.2, No.1. According to Denis Matthews, "The time-scale is luxurious, the harmonic progress leisurely; its humor ranges from the playful to the ferocious, with a few challenging outbursts of virtuosity that are offset by the surprisingly gentle ending of the final movement."

@792 The Largo Appassionato second movement of Beethoven's Piano Sonata in A, Op.2, No.2 is truly inspired.

@799 The first movement of Beethoven's Piano Sonata in E-flat, Op.7 opens dramatically. Marked Allegro molto e con brio, triumphant chords in the right hand are propelled by repeated E-flats in the left before the entry of a lyrical melody. The movement is exciting, virtuosic and filled with drama.

This sonata is a genuine masterpiece and not nearly played enough. It is remarkably long for an early sonata, its four movements needing a half hour to perform. It was composed from 1796-97 and interestingly dedicated to Babette von Keglevics, a young female student of Beethoven's (earning this sonata the nickname Die Verliebte, or The Amorous). Artaria of Vienna published the sonata  in 1797. Napolean's army was threatening Vienna at the time and Czerny reported that Beethoven composed the sonata while "in a very impassioned mood."

@803 The opening Allegro molto e con brio movement of Beethoven's Piano Sonata in C minor, Op.10, No.1 is dramatic and forceful. However, it is fairly light in texture and thus shows its classical lineage.

Beethoven is associated with the key of C minor because it anchors some of his most famous works including his 5th Symphony and the Pathétique Sonata. This sonata, perhaps because of its key, has been nicknamed the Little Pathétique. It was composed from 1796-98. Eder of Vienna first published the three sonatas of Op.10 in 1798. They were all dedicated to Anna Margarete von Browne, a pupil of Beethoven's, and wife of Count von Browne-Camus. Beethoven dedicated several compositions to the couple, and the Count once gave the composer a horse that Beethoven, obviously not an avid rider, soon forgot that he owned.

Sketches for the Op.10 sonatas show Beethoven struggling to get the right combination. Longer minuets and finales for the first two were eventually not included. Op.10 also sparked the first ever review in 1799 of Beethoven's sonatas. The reviewer wrote that Beethoven was "wildly piling up ideas and grouping them in a somewhat bizarre manner." It was, of course, the modern music of the time! This sonata is considered to be from Beethoven's First Period of composition in which he roughly conforms to the classical traditions of Haydn and Mozart.

This sonata was one of Beethoven's favorites. He wrote, "This sonata is a first-rate composition." According to Tovey, Beethoven also said "Die Sonate hat sich gewaschen" (which idiomatically means, This sonata takes the cake). It was composed from 1799-1800 and first published by Hoffmeister of Vienna in 1802. The dedication is to Johann Georg von Browne. David Dubal wrote that "it seems to sum up his ideas on sonata form at the moment. It's a wonderful, untroubled, extroverted work in four movements." This sonata is considered to be from Beethoven's First Period of composition in which he roughly conforms to the classical traditions of Haydn and Mozart.

@826 The Piano Sonata in A-flat, Op.26 is one of Beethoven's most unconventional sonatas. Not a single movement is in traditional sonata form and thus represents a clean break from the traditions of Haydn and Mozart. It opens with Andante con Variazioni. The beautiful theme, in A-B-A song form, is followed by five variations.

This sonata is considered by many to be the first of Beethoven's Second Period of composition which extends to the Sonata in E minor, Op.90. It was composed from 1800-01 and first published by Cappi of Vienna in 1802 along with the three sonatas of Op.26. It is dedicated to Carl von Lichnowsky. Apparently, it was one of the most popular sonatas in the 19th century and even Chopin, not a great fan of Beethoven, was said to have played the first movement. Sketches for the sonata go back to at least 1800. In his Second Period, Beethoven tried to expand the dimensions and form of the sonata without being restricted to classical convention.

@828 The third movement of Beethoven's Piano Sonata in A-flat, Op.26, Marcia funebre sulla morte d'un Eroe (Funeral march on the death of a hero), may originally have been a sketch for the Marcia funebre in the Eroica Symphony. Beethoven is said to have written this after hearing a similar one by written by Ferdinando Paer (1771-1839). He later orchestrated it for use in the play Eleonore Prohaska by Johann Duncker.

@830 Beethoven's Piano Sonata E-flat, Op.27, No.1 is the sister sonata of the famous Moonlight Sonata (Op.27, No.2), and has been neglected because of this. However, it is a masterpiece. Like the Moonlight, it was titled a Sonata quasi una Fantasia. The first movement is unusual in that it is not in sonata form. The tempo is Andante, although the slow pace is temporarily broken by an explosive Allegro section.

The sonata was composed from 1800-01 and published in 1802, along with the three Op.26 sonatas and the Moonlight, by Cappi of Vienna. It was dedicated to Josephin von Liechtenstein. All the movements are connected with Attaccas (an instruction to proceed directly into the next movement). This sonata is considered to be from Beethoven's Second Period of composition in which he tried to expand the dimensions and form of the sonata without being restricted to classical convention.

@833 The finale of Beethoven's Piano Sonata E-flat, Op.27, No.1 is a vigorous and exciting Allegro Vivace in 2/4 time. Its pace is interrupted briefly near the end by a quote of the Adagio movement's opening theme in a way that Wilhelm Kempff described as "not rising from twilight depths but on a higher and brighter level, a song of thanksgiving such as only Beethoven could create."

@834 Beethoven composed his famous Moonlight Piano Sonata C-sharp minor, Op.27, No.2 in 1801. It is named Sonata quasi una Fantasia, like its sister sonata, Op.27, No.1. Beethoven's dedication to Giulietta Guicciardi was apparently transfered at the last minute to this work from the Rondo in G, Op.51, No.2, so probably the sonata is not an indication of love to this 16 year old pupil as has been speculated. Both sonatas in Op.27, as well as the three sonatas of Op.26 were published together by Cappi of Vienna in 1802. The nickname "moonlight" was given to the work by the poet/musician Heinrich F.L. Rellstab, then a critic in Berlin, around 1832 and borrowed by the publisher. Rellstab claimed the title was prompted by the vision "of a boat on Lake Lucerne by a luminous night." According to Czerny, Beethoven resented the popularity of this sonata. "Everyone is always talking about the C-sharp minor sonata! Surely I have written better things." There was even a performance by Liszt in Paris in 1835 in which the pianist played the second and third movements, and an orchestra played the first. This sonata is considered to be from Beethoven's Second Period of composition in which he tried to expand the dimensions and form of the sonata without being restricted to classical convention.

The Adagio sostenuto first movement is not in traditional sonata form. Beethoven writes that "This whole piece must be played very delicately and with pedal." As David Dubal writes, "The first movement was truly something new, the emotion expressed having nothing in common with anything written previously."
