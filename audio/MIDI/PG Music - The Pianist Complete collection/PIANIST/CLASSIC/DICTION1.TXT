onwards) the sonata became a three or four movement work for solo 
instrument or for solo instrument with piano accompaniment. A similar 
work for three performers (often two violins and cello) is called a 
trio sonata. A violin sonata or cello sonata, etc. implies a piano 
accompaniment. The form of the first movement of the sonata was a 
feature and it became known as sonata form.

(sometimes after a slow introduction). (1) The exposition presents the 
first main subject in the home key, and a contrasting second subject 
in another key, which is generally the dominant if in a major key, or 
relative major if in a minor key. A closing theme is then heard 
related to the first subject, and brought to an end with a codetta; 
(2) The development consists of material already presented but 
expanded and developed upon; (3) The recapitulation presents a varied 
repetition of the exposition, now influenced by the development 
section and ending in the tonic key. The codetta now develops into a 
coda.

was often used by Beethoven.

Winterreise ('Winter Journey') composed in 1828 by Schubert. 
@759 song form\A title given to the basic A B A form or ternary form
