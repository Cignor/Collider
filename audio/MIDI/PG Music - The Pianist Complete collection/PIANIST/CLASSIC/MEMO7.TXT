@586 Waltz No. 11 in B minor, while simple, has interesting turns of harmony. Johannes Brahms' Waltzes for Piano with four hands, Op. 39 were first published in 1866, although they had probably been accumulating on the composer's desk for many years before that. They were completed in January of 1865, just before the death of Brahms' mother. Like the Liebesliederwalzer (Love-song waltzes), Op. 52, they are inspired by Schubert. There is a pleasant lightness to the sound and all of them are a joy to play.

@587 Mozart's Sonata in C, K.330 (K.V.300h) is one of the composer's most popular sonatas, apparently first improvised during a concert in Augsburg on October 22, 1777. Mozart wrote, "I then played... all of a sudden a magnificent sonata in C major, out of my head, and a Rondo to finish up with." He did write it down later and it was published by Artaria in 1784 as Opus 6. The cheerful first movement is an Allegro moderato in sonata form.

@588 The Andante cantabile second movement of Mozart's Sonata in C, K.330 (K.V.300h) is a Minuet and Trio. Interestingly, Mozart quotes and develops the opening phrase of the Trio in F minor at the end of the repeated Minuet, only this time in F major.

This is one of the composer's most popular sonatas, apparently first improvised during a concert in Augsburg on October 22, 1777. Mozart wrote, "I then played... all of a sudden a magnificent sonata in C major, out of my head, and a Rondo to finish up with." He did write it down later and it was published by Artaria in 1784 as Opus 6.

@589 The third movement of Mozart's Sonata in C, K.330 (K.V.300h) is a graceful Allegretto in sonata form. Interestingly, the last four bars were apparently added later.

@590 Mozart's Sonata in F, K.332 (K.V.300k) is considered one of his popular masterpieces and is often performed in recitals. It was composed in Paris in 1783 and first published by Artaria in 1784 as Opus 6. The first movement Allegro is both lyrical and dramatic.

@591 The Adagio second movement of Mozart's Sonata in F, K.332 (K.V.300k) is beautiful and graceful. The basic structure is simple, but there is elaborate ornamentation in the melody reminiscent of J.C. Bach.

This sonata is considered one of Mozart's popular masterpieces and is often performed in recitals. It was composed in Paris in 1783 and first published by Artaria in 1784 as Opus 6.

@592 Mozart's Sonata in F, K.332 (K.V.300k) finishes with a brilliant Allegro assai. It is written in sonata form and has both dramatic and lyrical elements.

@593 The Préamble which opens Schumann's Carnaval, Op.9 is made up of majestic chords before launching into a scampering and exhilirating Più Mosso section.

When Liszt met Clara Wieck (later Clara Schumann) in Vienna in 1838 and she played Carnaval for him, he exclaimed, "What a mind! This is one of the greatest works I have ever heard." Carnaval, Op.9 is one of Schumann's most successful compositions. He composed it in 1834-35 when aged 24-25 and dedicated it to Carl Lipinski. It was published by Breitkopf & Hartel in 1837.

The subtitle, Scènes mignonnes sur quatre notes, is because almost all the movements begin with the notes A, E-flat, C and B (in German, A, Es, C and H) or A-flat, C, and B (As, C and H) appear, the musical letters of Schumann's name, Asch also being a Bohemian town. Descriptive titles refer not only to carnival characters such as Pierrot, and Harlequin, but also to Schumann himself and his friends. At the Carnival, Schumann meets Pierrot, Pantalon and Columbine, Harlequin, Chiarina (the 16 year old Clara Wieck), and his current romantic interest, Estrella (Ernestine von Fricken, whose native town was Asch).

Schumann sent a copy of Carnaval to the pianist Ignaz Moscheles in 1837 with this note, "It will be child's play for you to figure out the masked ball. And I need hardly assure you that the titles and the arrangement of the pieces arose AFTER the pieces were already written." In another letter to Moscheles, however, Schumann explained that in spite of the descriptive titles and associations of the movements, "The titles I added later. Indeed, is not music sufficient unto itself, elequent in itself? ...All this has no artistic significance. The only interest seems to me to lie in the various spiritual states and moods."

@594 Pierrot is movement No.2 in Schumann's Carnaval. It paints an amusing picture, almost like a casual conversation with bursts of laughter.

@596 Valse Noble, No.4 in Schumann's Carnaval, is sensuous as well as majestic. Its middle section is tender but questioning.

@600 Because of the unity of thematic material, the movements of Schumann's Carnaval have powerful similarities and links. The short Réplique, No.8 in the set, clearly reminds us of past musical events.

Carnaval, Op.9 is one of Schumann's most successful compositions. He composed it in 1834-35 when aged 24-25 and dedicated it to Carl Lipinski. It was published by Breitkopf & Hartel in 1837.

The subtitle, Scènes mignonnes sur quatre notes, is because almost all the movements begin with the notes A, E-flat, C and B (in German, A, Es, C and H) or A-flat, C, and B (As, C and H) appear, the musical letters of Schumann's name, Asch also being a Bohemian town. Descriptive titles refer not only to carnival characters such as Pierrot, and Harlequin, but also to Schumann himself and his friends. At the Carnival, Schumann meets Pierrot, Pantalon and Columbine, Harlequin, Chiarina (the 16 year old Clara Wieck), and his current romantic interest, Estrella (Ernestine von Fricken, whose native town was Asch).

Schumann sent a copy of Carnaval to the pianist Ignaz Moscheles in 1837 with this note, "It will be child's play for you to figure out the masked ball. And I need hardly assure you that the titles and the arrangement of the pieces arose AFTER the pieces were already written." In another letter to Moscheles, however, Schumann explained that in spite of the descriptive titles and associations of the movements, "The titles I added later. Indeed, is not music sufficient unto itself, elequent in itself? ...All this has no artistic significance. The only interest seems to me to lie in the various spiritual states and moods."

@610 The continuous leaping staccato octaves that open Paganini, No.18 in Schumann's Carnaval, make it one of the most difficult movements in the set. After a pause, there is a return to the music of the Valse Allemande.

@611 Aveu, No.19 in Schumann's Carnaval, is a mere half page long but has its fair share of passion.

@612 Promenade is No.20 in Schumann's Carnaval. The melody, mainly in octaves or chords, has a bold sound, but the movement is not particularly difficult to play.

@613 Nos.21 and 22 of Schumann's Carnaval do not have a break between them, with the scurrying Pause leading directly into the triumphant and lengthy Marche des "Davidsbündler."

@614 The Sonata in D, K.284 (K.V.205b) was the only one of Mozart's first set of six sonatas to be published in his lifetime. This is deservedly so. The sonata (nicknamed the Dürnitz Sonata) was composed in Munich in 1775 and first published by Toricella in 1774 as Op.7. In October 1777, Mozart wrote to his father from Munich that the sonata "sounds exquisite on Stein's pianoforte." (Stein was the composer's favorite fortepiano maker.) The opening of the Allegro first movement is vigorous and immediately captivating. The conception seems orchestral.

Mozart's first group of six sonatas included those in C, F, B-flat, E-flat and G major (K.272-284).

@615 In the second movement Rondeau en Polonaise of Mozart's Sonata in D, K.284 (K.V.205b), the theme keeps returning with increasingly elaborate textures. K.284 was the only one of Mozart's first set of six sonatas to be published in his lifetime. This is deservedly so. The sonata (nicknamed the Dürnitz Sonata) was composed in Munich in 1775 and first published by Toricella in 1774 as Op.7.

@616 The last movement of Mozart's Sonata in D, K.284 (K.V.205b) is an Andante Theme and 12 Variations which many consider to be the composer's finest set of solo variations. The main theme is happy and lyrical. The variations are unusually inventive and virtuosic.

Mozart's first group of six sonatas included those in C, F, B-flat, E-flat and G major (K.272-284).

@617 Mozart's Sonata in F, K.280 (K.V.189e) was composed in Salzburg in 1774. The opening Allegro assai is in 3/4 time, and is not especially difficult to play. This was one of Mozart's first group of six sonatas which included those in C, B-flat, E-flat, G and D major (K.272-284). They all are appealing works, although they do not have the magnitude of Mozart's later works. Of the six, only the Sonata in D, K.284 (K.V.205b) was published while Mozart was alive.

@618 This moving Adagio, with its tragic overtones, is the second movement of Mozart's Sonata in F, K.280 (K.V.189e), composed in Salzburg in 1774. It was one of Mozart's first group of six sonatas which included those in C, B-flat, E-flat, G and D major (K.272-284). They all are appealing works, although they do not have the magnitude of Mozart's later works. Of the six, only the Sonata in D, K.284 (K.V.205b) was published while Mozart was alive.

@619 A humorous and spirited Presto in 3/8 time concludes Mozart's Sonata in F, K.280 (K.V.189e), composed in Salzburg in 1774. This was one of Mozart's first group of six sonatas which included those in C, B-flat, E-flat, G and D major (K.272-284). They all are appealing works, although they do not have the magnitude of Mozart's later works. Of the six, only the Sonata in D, K.284 (K.V.205b) was published while Mozart was alive.

@620 The Sonata in C, K.279 (K.V.189d) was Mozart's first piano sonata. It was composed in 1774 and was part of a group of six sonatas which included those in F, B-flat, E-flat, G and D major (K.272-284). They all are appealing works, although they do not have the magnitude of Mozart's later works. Of the six, only the Sonata in D, K.284 (K.V.205b) was published while Mozart was alive. The Allegro first movement of K.279 has typical Mozartian passage work.

@621 The slow movement of Mozart's Sonata in C, K.279 (K.V.189d) is an expressive Andante in 3/4 time and built almost entirely on eighth note triplets.

This was Mozart's first piano sonata. It was composed in 1774 and was part of a group of six sonatas which included those in F, B-flat, E-flat, G and D major (K.272-284). They all are appealing works, although they do not have the magnitude of Mozart's later works. Of the six, only the Sonata in D, K.284 (K.V.205b) was published while Mozart was alive.

@622 Mozart's Sonata in C, K.279 (K.V.189d) finishes with a fresh sounding and lively Allegro which shows touches of Haydn's influence.

This was Mozart's first piano sonata. It was composed in 1774 and was part of a group of six sonatas which included those in F, B-flat, E-flat, G and D major (K.272-284).

@623 The opening movement of Mozart's Sonata in C, K.309 (K.V.284b), Allegro con spirito, is impressive and conceived on a large scale. Mozart composed this sonata in Mannheim in 1777. At the time, he was teaching a young woman named Rosa Cannabich. In one of several letters to his father which mention this sonata, Mozart wrote in 1777 that "I am with Cannabich every day... He has a daughter who plays the clavier quite nicely; and in order to make a real friend of him I am now working at a sonata for her, which is almost finished save for the Rondo... The Andante will give us most trouble, for it is full of expression and must be played accurately and with the exact shades of forte and piano, precisely as they are marked...." The reply from Mozart's father Leopold: "Nannerl (Mozart's sister) plays your whole sonata excellently and with great expression. If you leave Mannheim, as I now presume you will, I shall have it copied and enclose a small sheet in every letter, so that you may have it again. Your sonata is a strange composition. It has something in it of the rather artificial Mannheim style, but so very little that your own good style is not spoilt thereby." The sonata was first published by Heina in 1782 as Opus 4.

@624 The second movement of Mozart's Sonata in C, K.309 (K.V.284b) is an Andante un poco adagio. It is expressive and displays lovely elaboration of the thematic material. Mozart composed this sonata in Mannheim in 1777. At the time, he was teaching a young woman named Rosa Cannabich. In one of several letters to his father which mention this sonata, Mozart wrote in 1777 that "I am with Cannabich every day...

@625 Rondeau. The finale of Mozart's Sonata in C, K.309 (K.V.284b) is a Rondeau. Marked Allegretto, it is on a large scale and is one of most effective rondos in all the sonatas. Mozart composed this sonata in Mannheim in 1777. At the time, he was teaching a young woman named Rosa Cannabich. In one of several letters to his father which mention this sonata, Mozart wrote in 1777 that "I am with Cannabich every day... He has a daughter who plays the clavier quite nicely; and in order to make a real friend of him I am now working at a sonata for her, which is almost finished save for the Rondo...

@626 Debussy's Suite Bergamasque is a tribute to the French clavecinistes of the 17-18th century. Composed in 1890, it wasn't published until 1905. Originally, the suite consisted of a Prélude, Menuet, Promenade Sentimentale (which presumably was renamed Clair de Lune), and Pavane. The opening Prelude is not technically difficult.

@627 The Menuet is the second movement of Debussy's Suite Bergamasque. The writing is similar to the Prelude, and includes some simple staccato chord passages. The suite is a tribute to the French clavecinistes of the 17-18th century. Composed in 1890, it wasn't published until 1905. Originally, the suite consisted of a Prélude, Menuet, Promenade Sentimentale (which presumably was renamed Clair de Lune), and Pavane.

@628 No.4 from Debussy's Suite Bergamasque is Passpied. A staccato broken-chord accompaniment in left hand supports the single note right hand melody, legato thirds and staccato chords. The suite is a tribute to the French clavecinistes of the 17-18th century. Composed in 1890, it wasn't published until 1905. Originally, the suite consisted of a Prélude, Menuet, Promenade Sentimentale (which presumably was renamed Clair de Lune), and Pavane.

@629 Mozart's Sonata in F, K.533 is actually a composite. The Allegro and Andante movements were composed in Vienna in 1788. The third movement Rondo was written in 1786 and catalogued as K.494. With Mozart's permission, they were published together in 1790 by Hoffmeister. The Allegro first movement is written on a broad scale and is very elaborate. It contains virtuoso arpeggio textures.

@630 The Andante second movement of Mozart's Sonata in F, K.533 has great nobility and deep emotion. There are also some unusual clashes of harmony. This sonata is actually a composite. The Allegro and Andante movements were composed in Vienna in 1788. The third movement Rondo was written in 1786 and catalogued as K.494. With Mozart's permission, they were published together in 1790 by Hoffmeister.

@631 The Rondo which forms the third movement of Mozart's Sonata in F, K.533 was originally a separate work. This sonata is a composite. The Allegro and Andante movements were composed in Vienna in 1788. The third movement Rondo was written in 1786 and catalogued as K.494. With Mozart's permission, they were published together in 1790 by Hoffmeister. The Allegretto Rondo is lighter in texture and finishes the sonata quite nicely.

@632 Mozart's Sonata in D, K.311 (K.V.284c) is an exuberant work composed in Munich and Mannheim in 1777 and first published by Heina in 1782 as Opus 4. The opening Allegro con spirito movement seems to reflect the sonorities of the famous orchestra of Mannheim which Mozart undoubtedly enjoyed. It is also has an unusual sonata form structure in that the opening theme doesn't return at the recapitulation and doesn't turn up again until near the end of the movement. Essentially, the themes come back in reverse order. Like the Sonata in C, K.309, this work was composed for Mozart's student, the young pianist Rosa Cannabich. Mozart even wrote, "She is a sweet, pretty girl, just like the Andante."

@633 The middle movement of Mozart's Sonata in D, K.311 (K.V.284c), Andante con espressione, has an innocent simplicity and charm. 

This sonata was composed in Munich and Mannheim in 1777 and first published by Heina in 1782 as Opus 4. Like the Sonata in C, K.309, it was written for Mozart's student, the young pianist Rosa Cannabich. Mozart even wrote, "She is a sweet, pretty girl, just like the Andante."
