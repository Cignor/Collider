of loudness according to the player's touch. Its sound was so small that it was 
suitable only for playing in small rooms. The harpsichord was used for 
concerts.

<2

@459 Where did the piano get its name?

\After its inventor, Christoph Pianorri
\Because it could be played softly
\*Because it could be played softly and loudly
\After the small Italian village of Piano where it was invented

^The original name "fortepiano" (and later "pianoforte") corresponded to the 
Italian musical terms of "forte" meaning loud, and "piano" meaning soft. In 
contrast to the popular harpsichord with a mechanism which "plucked" 
uniformly loud regardless of the player's touch, the new fortepiano used a 
levered hammer system which could deliver harder or softer blows to the 
instrument's strings.

<1

@460 When was the first true piano constructed?
\*1709
\1690
\1801
\1595

^It was constructed by Bartolomeo Cristofori of
Florence, Italy. He called it a "gravicembalo col piano e forte" meaning a 
'harpsichord with loudness and softness'. The Cristofori instruments had a 
range of 4 to 4-1/2 octaves.
<2

@461 What does a "prepared piano" mean in modern music terminology?

\*Inserting objects between the strings to alter the sound
\Tuning the strings in quarter tones
\Adding microphones and amplified speakers to the soundboard
\Baking in a large oven for two hours at 200 degrees

^20th century composers such as American John Cage have managed to 
produce music which calls for the performer to modify the sound of a piano 
by inserting anything from rubber mutes and strips of roof shingles to nuts 
and bolts between the strings, generally at specified locations and always to 
the horror of the piano technician. This tinkering gives a single pianist the 
ability to produce music that sounds like an exotic percussion ensemble.

\975 lbs.
\50 lbs.
