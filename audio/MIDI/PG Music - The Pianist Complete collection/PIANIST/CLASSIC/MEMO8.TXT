@634 The Rondeau finale which concludes Mozart's Sonata in D, K.311 (K.V.284c) is exceptionally brilliant with many contrasts. It is constructed on a large scale and has a cadenza before the final return of the opening theme.

This sonata was composed in Munich and Mannheim in 1777 and first published by Heina in 1782 as Opus 4. Like the Sonata in C, K.309, it was written for Mozart's student, the young pianist Rosa Cannabich. Mozart even wrote, "She is a sweet, pretty girl, just like the Andante."

@635 Mozart composed his Sonata in B-flat, K.333 (K.V.315c) in Paris in 1783, and it was first published by Toricella in 1784 as Opus 7. It is thought to have been influenced by Christian Bach who met Mozart in Paris in 1778 and may have shown him his Sonatas in G, Op.17 and B-flat, Op.6. It is an especially lyrical sonata, notably in the first movement Allegro, and this probably accounts for its great popularity.

@636 The second movement of Mozart's Sonata in B-flat, K.333 (K.V.315c) is an Andante cantabile which contains some bold harmony.

@637 The last movement of Mozart's Sonata in B-flat, K.333 (K.V.315c) is a charming and delicate Rondo marked Allegretto grazioso. It features two cadenzas.

@638 Mozart composed his Sonata in B-flat, K.281 (K.V.189f) in Salzburg in 1774. The themes of the opening Allegro have an interesting variety of rhythms. This was one of Mozart's first group of six sonatas which included those in C, F, E-flat, G and D major (K.272-284). They all are appealing works, although they do not have the magnitude of Mozart's later works. Of the six, only the Sonata in D, K.284 (K.V.205b) was published while Mozart was alive.

@639 In the slow movement of his Sonata in B-flat, K.281 (K.V.189f), Mozart uses the marking Andante amoroso for the only time in all of his sonatas. The movement has more poise and elegance, however, than overt affection. K.281 was one of Mozart's first group of six sonatas which included those in C, F, E-flat, G and D major (K.272-284). They all are appealing works, although they do not have the magnitude of Mozart's later works. Of the six, only the Sonata in D, K.284 (K.V.205b) was published while Mozart was alive.

@640 The Rondeau is the most interest movement in Mozart's Sonata in B-flat, K.281 (K.V.189f). It has a good variety of musical effects, including a short cadenza and extended trills. K.281 was one of Mozart's first group of six sonatas which included those in C, F, E-flat, G and D major (K.272-284). They all are appealing works, although they do not have the magnitude of Mozart's later works. Of the six, only the Sonata in D, K.284 (K.V.205b) was published while Mozart was alive.

@641 The Nocturne No.5 in B-flat, Op.37 was composed by Fauré in 1884. As often found in these nocturnes, a gently lyrical opening section is contrasted with an agitated middle dominated by triplet figures. It is dedicated to Madame Marie P. Christofle.

The thirteen Nocturnes are Gabriel Fauré's (1845-1924) finest collection of piano pieces. Although the name implies music of a subdued, soothing nature, most are substantial, mature works with considerable musical and technical difficulties for the performer.

@642 Fauré composed his Nocturne No.4 in E-flat, Op.36 in 1884 and dedicated it to the Countess of Mercy-Argentau.

@643 The word Scherzo and the associated musical concept means "joke". Beethoven certainly injected plenty of humour and zest into his scherzi. Chopin's Scherzo No.4 in E, Op.54 actually seems to fit the title. It has a happy mood and episodes of light hearted humor. The emphasis is on delicacy, lyricism and elegance. As David Dubal writes, "It is Chopin in a blessed moment, improvising and happy. His nerves are calm, and his deadly disease in check." Chopin composed this work in 1842.

@644 The thirteen Nocturnes are Gabriel Fauré's (1845-1924) finest collection of piano pieces. Although the name implies music of a subdued, soothing nature, most are substantial, mature works with considerable musical and technical difficulties for the performer. They have a great range of moods and complex harmonic progressions. The Nocturne No.1 in E-flat minor, Op.33, No.1 (composed in 1883, dedicated to Madame M. Baugnies) is a strikingly original piece which is full of sorrow.

@645 Fauré's Nocturne No.3 in A-flat, Op.33, No.3 resembles the nocturnes of Chopin. It features a lovely, expressive melody supported by a relative simple accompaniment. There are no great technical difficulties. Perhaps this is why it is so frequently played. It was composed in 1883 and dedicated to Madame A. Bohomoletz.

@646 Fauré's Nocturne No.2 in B, Op.33, No.2 was composed in 1883 and dedicated to Madame Louise Guyon. It opens with a gently lyrical Andantino espressivo followed by an anxious and agitated middle section. When the opening melody returns, it is presented more broadly in octaves.

@647 There is a spiritual feeling to Liszt's six short Consolations, S172. Composed from 1849-50, they are lyrical in character and some of Liszt's easiest piano works. The Consolation No.1 in E major is a mere twenty-five measures of simple chord and legato passages. This Andante con moto was intended to introduce Consolation No.2.

@648 Consolation No.2 in E major, marked Un poco più mosso, is built on a singing melody with a gentle accompaniment.

@649 Liszt's Consolation No.3 in D-flat (Lento placido), with its broken-chord left hand accompaniment supporting a sustained right hand cantilena, resembles a Chopin nocturne. It has become popular and is often heard without its companion pieces.

@653 Mozart's Sonata in A minor, K310 (K.V.300d) is considered one of the greatest solo piano works from the Classical period. It was composed in Paris in 1778, shortly after the death of the composer's mother in that same city in July. It is Mozart's first sonata written in the minor key. The tragic overtines are no doubt related to his mother's death. The march-like opening Allegro maestoso has orchestral fullness and stern rhythms.

@654 The second movement of Mozart's Sonata in A minor, K310 (K.V.300d) is an Andante cantabile con espressione in F major constructed in sonata form. Wanda Landowska speculated that this movement in 3/4 time "may be a minuet or a sarabande step." David Dubal thinks it "displays a restrained passion."

@655 The third movement finale of Mozart's Sonata in A minor, K310 (K.V.300d) is an agitated Rondo marked Presto. It has dark overtones and a what David Dubal calls a "persistent breathless rhythmic pattern."

@656 The first movement of Mozart's Viennese Sonatina in B-flat, Op.439b, No.4, Romanze, is an Andante in 2/2 time. It opens with a lovely treble theme in thirds. Although technically simple and useful for teaching material, the Six Viennese Sonatinas were mature works composed around 1783. Originally, they were written as Divertimenti for 2 Clarinets and Bassoon, K.439b. Mozart indicated that they could also be performed on either two bassett horns and a bassoon, or three bassett horns. The first piano transcription was published by Artaria, Vienna in the early 19th century.

@657 The second movement of Mozart's Viennese Sonatina in B-flat, Op.439b, No.4 is a Menuetto and Trio.

@659 The Nocturne No.16 in E-flat, Op.55, No.2 is strikingly beautiful and inspired. It was composed in 1843, quite late in Chopin's life. According to David Dubal, "One has only to compare the Field-like E-flat Nocturne of Op.9, No.2, to understand how far Chopin had traveled in pianistic layout and harmonic plenitude based on a personal contrapuntal approach, and a rarefication of melody."

Chopin's nineteen Nocturnes are his most introspective and genuinely subjective works. Irish composer John Field (1782-1837) may get the credit for inventing the piano Nocturne in the form of a lyrical, expressive melody supported by harmony, but it is Chopin who raised the form to its highest level. Most have a basic ternary (A B A) form, however, Chopin develops the basic melody with his own magical kind of ornamentation. Sometimes the melodies become very elaborate with cadenza-like flourishes, while undulating broken figures in the bass give support. The mood is generally meditative, in keeping with the title.

@660 Chopin's Nocturne No.14 in F-sharp minor, Op.48, No.2 was written in 1841. This not very well known work is relatively easy to play. It does, however, have subtle beauties, including a recitative-like middle section in D-flat and an especially beautiful coda.

@661 Lob der Thänen (Praise of Tears), R242 is a lied by Schubert transcribed by Liszt in 1837 and published in 1838. Schubert's song (D711), based on a poem by August Wilhelm von Schlegel, was composed in 1821 and published in 1822. Liszt's transcription was published in the collection Hommage aux dames de Vienne (dedicated to the Countess d'Apponyi). The English translation of the German lyrics: Tepid breezes, aroma of flowers, all the pleasures of springtime and youth, to taste the kisses of young lips, cradled softly on a tender breast. Then to steal the nectar of the grape, round dances and games and jokes: all that our senses gain for us: Ah, does it ever satisfy the heart? When moist eyes gleam with the gentle dew of melancholy, then, reflected in them, the field of heaven is unsealed to our gaze. How refreshingly, how instantly, every fierce blaze is extinguished; as it happens with flowers in the rain, the languid spirit recovers.

@662 Schubert's song Die Forelle (The Trout), D550, was composed in 1817, then revised four times between 1817 and 1821. Liszt transcribed two versions of the song and published them in 1846. Among his unusual liberties with this transcription, Liszt added a showy introduction, some cadenza-like interpolations and a final flourish. The original song was based on a poem by Christian F.D. Schubart. The English translation follows: In a bright brook the capricious trout shot by like an arrow in its happy haste. I stood on the bank and in sweet repose watched the merry fish swimming in the clear brook. A fisherman with his rod stood on the bank and cold-bloodedly watched the fish darting about. I thought, "As long as the water does not lack clarity, he will never catch the trout with his line." But finally the thief lost patience; he slyly muddied the brook, and before I knew it, his rod twitched and the little fish was wriggling on the hook. And I, all excited, looked at the deceived victim.

@663 In 1838, Liszt transcribed twelve Schubert lieder, including the famous Erlkönig (Erl-King). The transcription is very faithful to the original and the rapid, repeated octaves and chords require technical strength, although surprisingly not as much as the original, merciless Schubert accompaniment. Schubert's version, D328, was written in 1815. It is the best known of many settings of the Ballad by Goethe based on the Erl-King, King of all the spirits who appears to a child and entices him to death.

@664 The original Liebesbotschaft (Message of Love) is a lied by Schubert. Liszt transcribed 55 of Schubert's songs including half of the 24 Winterreise songs, 6 of the 20 songs in Müllerlieder, and the complete Schwanengesang cycle of 14 songs (composed in 1828 and catalogued as D957) of which Liebesbotschaft is No.1

@665 Transcribed in 1839 and first published in 1840, Der Lindenbaum (The Linden Tree) is the seventh of 12 piano transcriptions based on Schubert's Winterreise. The Schubert song was composed in February, 1827 and published in January 1828 as part of Opus 89. It is listed as D911/5. The English translation to the German lyrics: Beyond the gate and fountain a linden towers high; in dreams beneath its shadow the hours went sweetly by. Ah, many a tender message was graven in its bark, its presence gave me comfort when days were sad and dark. And now I pass beneath it, alone in deepest night, and in the utter darkness, I shut my two eyes tight. And then its branches rustle as if to call to me: "Come here, my good companion, for here at peace are we." The icy wind of winter was blowing in my face; my hat blew off and vanished, I did not slack my pace. The tree is far behind me, but as the miles increase, I still can hear it rustling: "Come here and find your peace!"

@666 Wohin? (Where?) is from Liszt's collection of transcriptions, 7 Lieder by Franz Schubert. Liszt transcribed 55 of Schubert's songs including the complete Schwanengesang cycle of 14 songs, half of the 24 Winterreise songs, and 6 of the 20 songs in Die schöne Müllerin, D795 (composed in 1823) of which Wohin? is No.2.

@667 Mozart composed his Sonata in E-flat, K.282 (K.V.189f) in Salzburg in 1774. It is unusual in that the usual first movement Allegro is replaced by an Adagio, although it still in sonata form.

This was one Mozart's first group of six sonatas which included those in C, F, B-flat, G and D major (K.272-284). They all are appealing works, although they do not have the magnitude of Mozart's later works. Of the six, only the Sonata in D, K.284 (K.V.205b) was published while Mozart was alive.

@668 Rather than a Minuet and Trio, Mozart uses two alternating minuets (Menuetto 1/Menuetto 2) for the second movement of his Sonata in E-flat, K.282 (K.V.189f).

@670 Ferrucio Busoni composed his Sonatina No.6, Fantasia da camera sur Carmen, K284 in 1920. This Carmen Fantasy is in the tradition of the fantasies by Franz Liszt. It is in five sections and is a showcase for many themes from Bizet's opera Carmen. It ends quietly as does the opera. Busoni lived from 1886-1924. It has a remarkable collection of themes from the opera.

@671 Mozart's Viennese Sonatina in F, Op.439b, No.5 opens with a lyrical Larghetto in 2/2 time.

@674 Le Rossignol (The Nightingale) was a song by Alabieff which was transcribed by Liszt in 1842 (it is catalogued as G.250/1). Although the original song is not well known, the transcription is delightful. It appears as the first piece in Deux Mélodies russes (No.2 was Chanson bohémianne). The transcription is a souvenir of Liszt's visit to St. Petersburg. He also composed Mazurka pour piano composée par un amateur de St. Petersbourg, paraphrasée par F.L.

@675 Il Lamento in A-flat is No.1 of Liszt's Trois Etudes de Concert (Three Concert Etudes), composed in 1848 and dedicated to Eduard Liszt. It is quite long and has been criticized for being repetitous, however, it does have a lyrical melody with a varied accompaniment that is effective.

@676 Liszt's Concert Etude No.2 in F minor, La Laggierezza, is deservedly popular. It has what has been described as a Chopinesque theme which is repeated with many variations. It has a climax which is built on chromatic thirds. This is graceful and perfectly written piano music.

@677 The Nocturne No.4 in F major, Op.15, No.1 (nicknamed "Les zéphyrs") was written by Chopin between 1830-1 and dedicated to the German pianist Ferdinand Hiller (1811-85). This is an outstanding, original work. It has a tender Andante theme with a magnificent, sharply contrasting Con fuoco trio section planned in double notes. The writer Barbedette, a contemporary of Chopin who often heard the composer perform, described this nocturne as "a calm and beautiful lake, ruffled by a sudden storm and becoming calm again."

Chopin's nineteen Nocturnes are his most introspective and genuinely subjective works.

@678 While not difficult to play, Chopin's Nocturne No.10 in A-flat major, Op.32, No.2 (Il lamento e la consolazione 1) has a lovely, gracious melodic line played with the outer fingers while being supported by chords in the middle texture. It was composed from 1836-7 and is featured in the ballet Les Sylphides which is set to Chopin's music.

@679 Mozart composed his Fantasy in C minor, K.396 (385f) in 1782. In spite of its name and the implication of free improvisation, the Fantasy is an adagio in sonata form. It is fine work which Maurice Hinson describes as "dignified in its Baroque grandeur." Particularly interesting is that only the exposition was actually written by Mozart. It was completed by one of his obviously competent understudies.

@680 Haydn's Sonata No.42 (Divertimento) in G, Hob.XVI/27 (sometimes listed as Op.14, No.1) was composed sometime before 1776. The first movement is marked Allegro con brio and features an ornamented opening theme that is both elegant and charming.

As with Beethoven's piano sonatas, Haydn's sonatas (written between 1760 and 1794) show the evolution of the composer. They increasingly appear as true pianoforte rather than harpsichord works. Unlike Mozart, there is an absence of operatic inspiration or imitation. His sonatas are purely instrumental works with a robust type of expression and humor which inspired Beethoven.

@681 The second movement of Haydn's Sonata No.42 (Divertimento) in G, Hob.XVI/27 (sometimes listed as Op.14, No.1) is a Minuet and Trio. The G major Minuet is built on triplets, while the Trio in G minor uses straight eighth notes with ornamentation.

@689 Schubert composed his Ungarische Melodie (Hungarian Melody) in B minor, D817 in 1824. It is a simple work with lots of dotted rhythms and grace notes in the right hand to help create a Hungarian character. It was also the first, shorter version of the third movement of the piano duet, Divertisement à l'hongroise in G minor, D818 (also composed in 1824).

@690 Danseuses de Delphes (Delphic Dancers) is the first of Debussy's Preludes Bk.1. It portrays three bacchantes performing a dignified dance. While visiting the Louvre, Debussy had seen a pillar found in the ruins of an ancient Greek villa. At the top of the pillar, the three dancers were depicted in sculpture. Modal, diatonic, pentatonic, and chromatic elements give this slow-moving prelude a grave yet exotically mysterious tone. Debussy himself gave the first public performance of this prelude, along with Voiles, La Cathédrale engloutie and La danse de Puck (which he played again as an encore) at the Société Musicale Indépendante on May 25, 1910.

Debussy's wrote two books of Preludes, the first composed in 1910 and the second from 1910-13. They are fine examples of the composer's ability to vividly describe things of both real and imaginary worlds in music. Each set has twelve preludes (in the Bach mold). He admitted that "They are not all good" and did not expect them to be played as a complete set.

@691 Voiles (Veils or Sails) is No.2 in Debussy's First Book of Preludes. It is built almost entirely on the whole-tone scale. Composer Edgard Varèse said the piece was inspired by the diaphanous veils of the American dancer Loïe Fuller, who was famous in Paris at the time. Debussy himself gave the first public performance of this prelude, along with Danseuses de Delphes, Voiles, La Cathédrale engloutie and La danse de Puck (which he played again as an encore) at the Société Musicale Indépendante on May 25, 1910. He felt that it shouldn't be played with too much color. The mood should convey "sailing boats anchored to a fixed pedal-point" and also "mysterious veils enveloping palpitating feminine forms, hiding eyes which fan desire by their devious glances."

@692 La vent dans las plaine (The wind in the plain) is No.3 from Debussy's first book of Preludes. According to the critic Edward Lockspeiser, "The invisibility of the wind is meant above all to be mysterious and on a long suspended B-flat, the piece ultimately disappears into thin air."

He admitted that "They are not all good" and did not expect them to be played as a complete set.

@693 Les sons et les parfums tournent dans l'air du soir (Sounds and scents swirl in the evening air) is No.4 from Debussy's first Book of Preludes. It was inspired by a line from the poem Harmonie du Soir from Les Fleurs du mal by Baudelaire. While not technically difficult to play, it requires imagination and sensitive tonal balance.

He admitted that "They are not all good" and did not expect them to be played as a complete set.

@694 Les collines d'Anacapri (The hills of Anacapri) is No.5 from Debussy's first Book of Preludes. It is a brilliant work mainly in a tarantella rhythm, with bell sounds and wild dancing. Debussy also used folksong-like material. The tarantella rhythm and expressive Neapolitan melody alternate, and then sound simultaneously. Debussy asks the pianist to "play luminously." It is one of the most difficult Preludes to play.

@695 Des pas sur la neige (Footsteps in the snow) is No.6 from Debussy's first Book of Preludes. He added the instructions, Ce rythme doit avoir la valeur sonore d'un fond de paysage triste et glacé (This rhythm should have the sonorous value of a melancholy, ice-bound, landscape). While technically simple, it creates a feeling of desolation with just a few notes. Pianist Claudio Arrau wrote that it speaks of "a sadness, an intolerable dilemma."

@696 Ce qu'a vu le Vent d'Ouest (What the West Wind has seen) is No.7 from Debussy's first Book of Preludes. This is the most technically challenging work in the set. Powerful chords, broken octaves and tremolando passages portray the destructive power of the West Wind. It is thought that Debussy may have been inspired by Shelley's Ode to the West Wind.

@697 No.9 from Debussy's first Book of Preludes, La sérénade interrompue (The interrupted serenade) portrays a Spanish guitarist trying to sing his love song, but who keeps being interrupted. It is a humorous piece with guitar effects and sharp tonal contrasts.

@698 No.11 from Debussy's first Book of Preludes, La dans de Puck (Puck's Dance) is inspired by a character from Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. It requires delicacy and technical facility. Debussy himself gave the first public performance of this prelude (which he played again as an encore), along with Danseuses de Delphes, Voiles, and La Cathédrale engloutie at the Société Musicale Indépendante on May 25, 1910.

@699 Minstrels is No.12 from Debussy's first Book of Preludes. It is a humorous music-hall style piece inspired by the American cakewalk. The American Minstrel shows were popular at the time, and in addition to this prelude, Debussy used the cakewalk style in the Golliwog's Cake Walk from his Children's Corner Suite.

@700 In September 1904, after composing L'Isle joyeuse, Debussy wrote to his publisher, "Heavens! How difficult it is to play.... This piece seems to embrace every possible manner of treating the piano, combining as it does strength and grace... if I may presume to say so." It is a brilliant work for the piano requiring unrelenting rhythmic drive, clear and strong pianism, and a vivid sense of musical color. It was inspired by the famous painting The Embarkment for Cythère by Watteau. The Spanish pianist Ricardo Viñes (1875-1943) gave the first performance. Following Debussy's instructions, a very successful orchestral was created by the Italian conductor Bernardino Molinari in 1917.

@701 An energetic Presto opens Clementi's Sonatina, Op.36, No.5 in G major. Triplet eighth notes propel the music forward in this fairly long movement. The Opus 36 Sonatinas are the most frequently played works of this type in history. They have immediate musical appeal. They focus on the most important techniques in piano playing, including sensible fingering, good phrasing, legato touch, plus they are in a pure and clear classical style.

Muzio Clementi (1752-1832), an Italian pianist and composer, has sometimes been called the father of modern pianoforte playing. He was considered one of the finest living pianists in Europe, even the equal of Mozart (although the latter dismissed Clementi as a technician and an inferior composer). He was admired by many composers, including Beethoven (who studied Clementi's Sonatas carefully).

@702 The middle movement of Clementi's Sonatina, Op.36, No.5 in G major is titled Air Suisse (original). The left hand accompaniment acts largely as a drone to the right hand melody. The Opus 36 Sonatinas are the most frequently played works of this type in history. They have immediate musical appeal. They focus on the most important techniques in piano playing, including sensible fingering, good phrasing, legato touch, plus they are in a pure and clear classical style.

@703 The last movement of Clementi's Sonatina, Op.36, No.5 in G major is a lively Rondo marked Allegro di molto. Again, Clementi uses many dynamic contrasts to give the movement energy. The Opus 36 Sonatinas are the most frequently played works of this type in history. They have immediate musical appeal. They focus on the most important techniques in piano playing, including sensible fingering, good phrasing, legato touch, plus they are in a pure and clear classical style.

Italian pianist and composer Muzio Clementi (1752-1832) has sometimes been called the father of modern pianoforte playing. He certainly developed a reputation throughout Europe as one of the finest living pianists, even the equal of Mozart (although the latter dismissed Clementi as a technician and an inferior composer). He did have the admiration of many composers, including Beethoven (who studied Clementi's Sonatas carefully). His musically appealing piano Sonatinas are still basic repertoire in the training of young pianists. The six Sonatinas, Op. 36, have become especially popular.

His musically appealing piano Sonatinas are still basic repertoire in the training of young pianists. The six Sonatinas, Op.36, have become especially popular. No.6 in D only has two movements, dispensing with the slow. This second movement is a Rondo marked Allegretto spiritoso.

@705 Brouillards (Mists) is the first of Debussy's second Book of Preludes. It is a mysterious, delicate work in which the accompaniment figuration surrounds a subtle melodic line.

@706 Feuilles mortes (Dead leaves) is No.2 from Debussy's second Book of Preludes. It is similar to Les sons et les parfums tournent dans l'air du soir (Prelude No.4, Bk.1). It conveys what Debussy described as golden leaves celebrating the glorious agony of the trees.

@707 Les fées sont d'exquises danseuses (The fairies are exquisite dancers) is No.4 from Debussy's second Book of Preludes. It is a delicate work which, as the pianist Ernest Ulmer wrote, "is dedicated to the ephemeral charm of fairy-tale sylphs."

@708 Bruyères (Heaths or Heather), No.5 from Debussy's second Book of Preludes, is one of the easiest to play. It is a scene from the moors of Scotland and has a gentleness similar to the composer's La fille aux cheveux de lin (The girl with the flaxen hair).

@709 La terrasse des audiences du clair de lune (The moon holds her court, or The Terrace for Moonlight Audiences) is No.7 from Debussy's second Book of Preludes. Debussy's imagination had been inspired by a letter by French autor René Puaux that had been published in Le Temps. It described the coronation of George V as emperor of Indian and read, "The hall of victory, the hall of pleasure, the garden of the sultanesses, the terrace for moonlight audiences." This prelude requires delicacy and great tonal control.

@710 No.8 from Debussy's second Book of Preludes, Ondine, portrays the capriciousness of the mythological water nymph. Unlike Ravel's Ondine, a siren that lures sailor's to their death, Debussy's is a young and tempting character that Paul Jacobs described as, "merely a sprite whose music is shimmering laughter." This is one of the most technically challenging of the Preludes.

@711 Debussy's fascination with England led to Hommage à S. Pickwick, Esq. P.P.M.P.C., No.9 from Debussy's second Book of Preludes, and a tribute to Charles Dickens. Mr. Pickwick, of course, is a Dicken's character, and this prelude tries to present many psychological twists and turns. It is humorous and even begins with a quote from God Save the King.

@712 A canope is the covering of an Egyptian funeral urn, and also the name of a city in ancient Egypt. Canope is No.10 from Debussy's second Book of Preludes. It is a mournful, atmospheric little piece which is not too difficult to play.

@713 Les tierces alternées (Alternating thirds), No.11 from Debussy's second Book of Preludes, is the only piece in the sets which is not descriptive. It is an etude in which the two hands rapidly alternate with the sound rarely rising to a forte. There is mainly a dynamic rise and fall and softer levels.

@714 Chopin composed the Nocturne No.1 in B-flat minor, Op.9, No.1 (Murmures de la Sein 1) in 1830-1 when he was just 21 years old. It opens with a lovely but sadly tragic cantabile melody. It is an openly emotionally moving work that has immediate appeal. Jean Kleczynski wrote that it "exhibits a thrilling sadness, together with a novel eloquence of construction". Chopin dedicated the three nocturnes of Opus 9 to the pianist Camille Pleyel. It was said that all who heard her play, including Berlioz and Liszt, fell in love.

Chopin's nineteen Nocturnes are his most introspective and genuinely subjective works. Irish composer John Field (1782-1837) may get the credit for inventing the piano Nocturne in the form of a lyrical, expressive melody supported by harmony, but it is Chopin who raised the form to its highest level. Most have a basic ternary (A B A) form, however, Chopin develops the basic melody with his own magical kind of ornamentation. Sometimes the melodies become very elaborate with cadenza-like flourishes, while undulating broken figures in the bass give support. The mood is generally meditative, in keeping with the title.

@715 The Nocturne No.3 in B major, Op.9, No.3 (Murmures de la Seine3) is a charming Allegretto (scherzando). It sparkles with charm and lightness and, except for a dramatic Agitato middle section, avoids the tragedy and sadness which colors many of the composer's nocturnes. Chopin dedicated the three nocturnes of Opus 9 to the pianist Camille Pleyel. It was said that all who heard her play, including Berlioz and Liszt, fell in love. This nocturne was composed 1830-1.

@716 Composed in 1846, the Nocturne No.17 in B major, Op.62, No.1 is, according to Friskin and Freundlich, "another composition of Chopin's creative maturity". Its opening, arpeggiated chord is like a pair of arms unfolding to greet you. The melody is warm and unfolds continually. David Dubal describes it as "a work of pure luxuriance."
