  You will find that the operation is much more efficient when more 
  memory is available to the program. You can make more memory available
  to the Pianist by disabling the Dictonary and Biography files. To do this
  execute the following from the DOS prompt:
        rename Bio*.txt Bio*.sav
        rename Diction*.txt Diction*.sav
  This will improve operation for users with 2mb. Users with 3mb or more
  don't need to do this.

Have Fun !
