@721 Although short, the Andante of Clementi's Sonatina, Op.36, No.1 in C is a lovely and lyrical slow movement. The Opus 36 Sonatinas are the most frequently played works of this type in history. They have immediate musical appeal. They focus on the most important techniques in piano playing, including sensible fingering, good phrasing, legato touch, plus they are in a pure and clear classical style.

Muzio Clementi (1752-1832), an Italian pianist and composer, has sometimes been called the father of modern pianoforte playing. He was considered one of the finest living pianists in Europe, even the equal of Mozart (although the latter dismissed Clementi as a technician and an inferior composer). He was admired by many composers, including Beethoven (who studied Clementi's Sonatas carefully).

@723 Haydn's Sonata No.35 in A-flat, Hob.XVI/43 was composed sometime before 1783. The Moderato first movement is spritely and march-like. The texture is delicate and the melody ornamented with trills.

As with Beethoven's piano sonatas, Haydn's sonatas (written between 1760 and 1794) show the evolution of the composer. They increasingly appear as true pianoforte rather than harpsichord works. Unlike Mozart, there is an absence of operatic inspiration or imitation. His sonatas are purely instrumental works with a robust type of expression and humor which inspired Beethoven.

@724 The second movement of Haydn's Sonata No.35 in A-flat, Hob.XVI/43 consists of two minuets, the first with a sharply rhythmic motif, and the second being more melodic.

@726 Robert Schumann considered the Sonata in A minor (Grande Sonate), Op.143, D784 one of Schubert's best. It was composed in 1823 and was the first piano sonata Schubert had written for several years. The opening movement is original and imaginative. The texture is lean and the development is powerful.

Although Schubert wrote 23 sonatas, only eleven complete works are now standard repertoire. Only three, D845, D850 and D894 were published before Schubert's death.

@727 The Andante movement of Schubert's Sonata in A minor (Grande Sonate), Op.143, D784 is like a lovely song punctuated with one grand chordal section.

@729 In a review of Chopin's Scherzo No.1 in B minor, Schumann in the role of critic wrote, "How are seriousness and gravity to be clothed if jest is to go about in such dark-colored garments?" Indeed, the word and musical concept means "joke" and Beethoven put plenty of humour and zest into his Scherzi. The B minor Scherzo is hardly humorous. In fact, the title seems appropriate for Scherzo No.4. In No.1, dramatic, long opening chords spark a fiery and agitated Presto con fuoco. The only rest is the beautiful middle Molto più lento section based on the Polish Christmas carol Lulajze Jezuniu (Sleep, Jesus Sleep). This is one of Chopin's few uses of authentic folk material. The first section then repeats, leading to a ferocious Coda which finishes with a long, rising chromatic scale and then crashing chords. Chopin composed this Scherzo in 1831-2 and it was first published in 1835. Much to his annoyance, an English edition appeared later with the title The Infernal Banquet.

@730 Mozart's Sonata in B-flat, K.570 was composed in Vienna in 1789. It is a lovely work with a spacious and sometimes contrapuntal design. David Dubal calls it "a model of sonata design." The opening Allegro is in 3/4 time and unfolds elegantly. A piano and violin version of this sonata exists. It is believed that the violin part was added by the publisher André or Artaria.

@733 Composed in Vienna in 1789, Mozart's last Sonata in D, K.576 has been nicknamed the Hunt or Trumpet Sonata because of its horn-like opening theme. It is the only completed sonata in what was to be a set of Six Easy Clavier Sonatas for Princess Friederike that Mozart planned to write in 1789. It is actually one of the most technically difficult of Mozart's sonatas and uses a considerable amount of counterpoint. The Allegro first movement is in 6/8 time and presents its "hunt" theme in both hands playing at the octave. The development section, featuring imitative passages, is particularly well crafted.

@734 The Adagio second movement of Mozart's Sonata in D, K.576 is profoundly expressive. He also takes the unusual step of including written-out ornaments.

@736 Mozart's Sonata in G, K.283 (K.V.189h) is a charming, unpretentious sonata composed in Salzburg in 1774. The thematic material of the opening Allegro is straightforward and immediately appealing.

This was one Mozart's first group of six sonatas which included those in C, F, B-flat, E-flat and D major (K.272-284). They all are appealing works, although they do not have the magnitude of Mozart's later works. Of the six, only the Sonata in D, K.284 (K.V.205b) was published while Mozart was alive.

Schumann composed the 43 pieces of Album für die Jugend (Album for the Young), Op.68 in only fourteen days in 1848 at the age of 38. They were originally planned to be supplemented by extracts from works of other composers. Also, Schumann's sketch books, which contain many of the pieces, had accompanying "instructions to young musicians", which show their intended use as teaching material. Nos.1-17 were labeled Beginning Part 1: Für Kleinere (for youngsters). No.18 begins Part 2, Für Erwachsenere (for adults). David Dubal wrote that the album is "the greatest of children's musical storybooks, and the prototypes for countless children's pieces since. All that is lovable and tenderhearted in Schumann's nature is found here." The music was first published by Schubert in 1851.

@781 The Nocturne in C minor, Opus posthumous was discovered in the 20th century and first published in 1938. Although composed 1847-48, it is a short and relatively simple work and certainly not representative of the mature Chopin. As with the Nocturne, Op.post. in C-sharp minor, it is not included in all editions of the nocturnes. 

Chopin's nineteen Nocturnes are his most introspective and genuinely subjective works. Irish composer John Field (1782-1837) may get the credit for inventing the piano Nocturne in the form of a lyrical, expressive melody supported by harmony, but it is Chopin who raised the form to its highest level. Most have a basic ternary (A B A) form, however, Chopin develops the basic melody with his own magical kind of ornamentation. Sometimes the melodies become very elaborate with cadenza-like flourishes, while undulating broken figures in the bass give support. The mood is generally meditative, in keeping with the title.

@782 The Nocturne in C-sharp minor, Opus posthumous is boldly titled Lento con gan espressione and dedicated to Chopin's sister Louise. A later edition elaborates on the dedication: "To my sister Louise to practise before she starts playing my Second Concerto". It was written in 1830 and found among the composer's manuscripts after his death. First published in 1875, and not included in all editions of the Chopin Nocturnes, it has found some popularity while at the same time being criticized for being unrepresentative of the composer.

@783 Chopin composed his Nocturne No.7 in c-sharp, Op.27, No.1 in 1835. It is a deeply personal, tragic work. The form is A-B-A followed by a coda. The climax is powerful and has a restless quality. It has the nickname "Les plaintives". Alan Rich, a critic, described this nocturne as "one of the most personal utterances in the entire realm of piano music."

@784 The Sonata in A major, Op.120, D664, composed in 1819, is the best known of Schubert's sonatas. It is a short work with few technical difficulties. The first movement is lyrical and charming although, except for a short octave passage in the middle, it lacks the dramatic contrasts usually found in sonata-allegro movements.

Although Schubert wrote 23 sonatas, only eleven complete works are now standard repertoire. Only three, D845, D850 and D894 were published before Schubert's death.

@785 The second movement of Schubert's Sonata in A major, Op.120, D664 is an Andante which David Dubal writes "can only be called Schubertian in its bittersweet beauty." It shows Schubert's characteristic alternation between major and minor.

Although Schubert wrote 23 sonatas, only eleven complete works are now standard repertoire. Only three, D845, D850 and D894 were published before Schubert's death.

@786 The Allegro Finale of Schubert's Sonata in A major, Op.120, D664 is the liveliest and most technically challenging of the three movements. It is written in sonata form.

Although Schubert wrote 23 sonatas, only eleven complete works are now standard repertoire. Only three, D845, D850 and D894 were published before Schubert's death.
