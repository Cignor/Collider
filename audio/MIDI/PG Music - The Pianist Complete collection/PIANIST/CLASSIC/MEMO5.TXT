@480 Schumann's song Frühlingsnacht (Spring Night) was composed in 1840. Franz liszt's transcription was probably written around 1848. It is filled with rapidly repeated chords, beginning delicately and then building to strong climaxes. As a master transcriber, Liszt (1811-86) produced piano versions of works by many other composers which are remarkably faithful to the originals. In concerts, Liszt often performed the transcriptions before the public had even heard the original versions.

@481 Peter Tchaikovsky's (1840-1893) famous piano piece Chant sans paroles (Song without words), Op. 40, was first composed in June-July of 1867 and first published in 1868 as No. 3 in Souvenir de Hapsal - Trois morceaus, Op. 2. Tchaikovsky's piano music has often been underated and rarely played, existing in the shadow of the composer's great ballets and symphonies. However, it has honesty and charm, and many of the over one hundred piano pieces are not technically difficult and accessible to almost any pianist.

@482 This is a solo arrangement of Johannes Brahms' rousing Hungarian Dance No. 2. Brahms' original version comes from his set of 21 duets published in four volumes between 1852-69 as Ungarische Tänze (Hungarian Dances). Brahms also orchestrated three of them.

@483 Born in Italy but educated in Germany, Ferrucio Busoni (1866-1924) is known to have been one of the great pianistic talents of his time. Like many of history's legendary pianists, he not only possessed great keyboard skills but also significant compositional ability. His original music is rarely played today, however, some of his transcriptions of music by other composers survive both on stage and in recordings. His arrangement of the famous Chaconne from J.S. Bach's fourth Partita for solo violin, BMV 1004 grew popular with many performers. According to writer Maurice Hinson, "Busoni managed by skillful use of all the piano's resources to give this work a wholly new personality, without in any way betraying Bach's intentions and without fundamentally altering the thematic and rhythmic contents." There also exists another transcription of the Chaconne, based on Busoni's, by Alexander Siloti (1863-1945).

@484 Le Secret (Intermezzo Pizzicato) by L. Gautier is an old favorite from the turn of the century. Of course on the piano, the pizzicatos (the kind of sounds produced by plucking normally bowed string instruments) become staccatos.

@485 Peter Ilyitch Tchaikovsky's Toy Soldiers' March was No. 5 of the 24 pieces in his Album for the Young, Op. 39. Tchaikovsky (1840-93) needed a rest after having recently produced not only his Fourth Symphony but his opera Eugene Onegin. In February of 1878, he wrote to his publisher that he wanted to write some children's music for relaxation and perhaps profit. The publisher gave him the go ahead, and the results were this Album for the Young, completed in May of 1878.

@486 Rosamunde, Fürsten von Cypern (Rosamund, Princess of Cyprus) was a play written by Helmina von Chézy. Franz Schubert composed an overture as well as two ballet pieces and other incidental music for it in 1823. 
@487 Felix Mendelssohn composed his famous overture to Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream in 1826 when he was only 17 years old. He composed additional incidental music for a production of the play in 1843 (including the famous Wedding March - an arrangement included in The Pianist). 
@488 Johannes Brahms (1833-97) modelled his Liebesliederwalzer (Love-song waltzes), Op. 52 on the light-hearted Schubert Ländlers (a type of slow waltz originating in Austria's Landel). They appeared in 1869 for piano duet with optional (ad libitum) vocal quartet (soprano, alto, tenor & bass). The same set of eighteen waltzes were published without the vocal parts as Op. 52a. The verse for the waltzes are from the poem Polydora by Daumer. The opening of the verse for Waltz No. 6 in A major follows in both German and the English translation: Ein kleiner, hübscher Vogel nahm den Flug; Zum Garten hin, da gab es Obst genung. Wenn ich ein hübscher, kleiner Vogel wär', Ich säumte nicht, ich thäte so wieder. (A pretty little bird flew into a garden laden with fruit; if I were a pretty, little bird, I wouldn't delay, I'd do as he did.)

@489 Johannes Brahms (1833-97) modelled his Liebesliederwalzer (Love-song waltzes), Op. 52 on the light-hearted Schubert Ländlers (a type of slow waltz originating in Austria's Landel). They appeared in 1869 for piano duet with optional (ad libitum) vocal quartet (soprano, alto, tenor & bass). The same set of eighteen waltzes were published without the vocal parts as Op. 52a. The verse for the waltzes are from the poem Polydora by Daumer. The opening of the verse for Waltz No. 7 in C minor follows in both German and the English translation: Wohl schöne bewandt; War es vorehe; Mit meinem Leben, Mit meiner Liebe; (What happy days I knew once, when my love was all my life.)

@490 Johannes Brahms (1833-97) modelled his Liebesliederwalzer (Love-song waltzes), Op. 52 on the light-hearted Schubert Ländlers (a type of slow waltz originating in Austria's Landel). They appeared in 1869 for piano duet with optional (ad libitum) vocal quartet (soprano, alto, tenor & bass). The same set of eighteen waltzes were published without the vocal parts as Op. 52a. The verse for the waltzes are from the poem Polydora by Daumer. The opening of the verse for Waltz No. 8 in A-flat major follows in both German and the English translation: Wenn so lind dein Auge mir, Und so lieblich schauet, Jede letzte Trübe flieht, Welche mich umgrauet. (When you gaze at me so gently,
with such lovely eyes, all the troubles which once distraught me flee away.)

@491  Mein gläubiges Herze, frohlocke, sing', scherze (My heart ever faithful) from J.S. Bach's (1685-1750) Cantata No. 68 is a fine example of the master's work. The piano writing is robust, with the melody moving through various voices, the left hand crossing over the right, and with a fortissimo ending with chords and octaves.

@492   Schafe können sicher weiden (Sheep may safely graze), Pale's Aria, is taken from J.S. Bach's Secular Cantata No. 8. Almost all of Bach's nearly two hundred catatas were of a religious nature, but several, including this one, are written on non-religious themes.

@493 French composer Charles Gounod (1818-93) created his successful opera Faust in 1859, originally with spoken dialogue, and by 1869 evolving into a full-fledged opera with recitatives and ballet. This is famous March from the opera.

@494 Flowers that Bloom in the Spring is from Gilbert & Sullivan's The Mikado (1885). The Mikado humorously shows a British view of Japanese culture at the end of the 19th century. British playwright William Schwenck Gilbert (1836-1911) met composer Arthur Seymour Sullivan (1842-1900) in 1871. The series of comic operettas they penned together - including H.M.S. Pinafore (1878), The Pirates of Penzance (1880), The Mikado and The Gondoliers (1889) - made their names household words to this day, whether it be Gilbert & Sullivan, or even simply "G & S". London's Savoy Theatre was actually built in 1881 to house the Gilbert & Sullivan productions. Gilbert had been a journalist and drama critic for various London periodicals. Sullivan was actually a distinguished composer and conductor, producing many serious works including chamber music, operas and symphonic music.

@495 When a Merry Maiden Marries is from Gilbert & Sullivan's The Gondoliers (1889). British playwright William Schwenck Gilbert (1836-1911) met composer Arthur Seymour Sullivan (1842-1900) in 1871. The series of comic operettas they penned together - including H.M.S. Pinafore (1878), The Pirates of Penzance (1880), The Mikado (1885) and The Gondoliers - made their names household words to this day, whether it be Gilbert & Sullivan, or even simply "G & S".

Sullivan was actually a distinguished composer and conductor, producing many serious works including chamber music, operas and symphonic music.

@496 This is Willow, Tit-Willow from Gilbert & Sullivan's The Mikado (1885). British playwright William Schwenck Gilbert (1836-1911) met composer Arthur Seymour Sullivan (1842-1900) in 1871. The series of comic operettas they penned together - including H.M.S. Pinafore (1878), The Pirates of Penzance (1880), The Mikado and The Gondoliers (1889) - made their names household words to this day, whether it be Gilbert & Sullivan, or even simply "G & S". London's Savoy Theatre was actually built in 1881 to house the Gilbert & Sullivan productions. Gilbert had been a journalist and drama critic for various London periodicals. Sullivan was actually a distinguished composer and conductor, producing many serious works including chamber music, operas and symphonic music. Here are Gilbert's words: On a tree by a river a little tom-tit, Sang 'Willow, titwillow, titwillo!' And I said to him, 'Dicky-bird, why do you sit, Singing "Willow, titwillow, titwillow"?' 'Is it weakness of intellect, birdie?' I cried, 'Or a rather tough worm in your little inside?' With a shake of his poor little head, he replied, 'Oh, willow, titwillow, titwillow!'

@497 I am the Captain of the Pinafore is from Gilbert & Sullivan's H.M.S. Pinafore (1878). British playwright William Schwenck Gilbert (1836-1911) met composer Arthur Seymour Sullivan (1842-1900) in 1871. The series of comic operettas they penned together - including H.M.S. Pinafore, The Pirates of Penzance (1880), The Mikado (1885) and The Gondoliers (1889) - made their names household words to this day, whether it be Gilbert & Sullivan, or even simply "G & S".

@498 Poor Wand'ring One is from Gilbert & Sullivan's The Pirates of Penzance (1880). British playwright William Schwenck Gilbert (1836-1911) met composer Arthur Seymour Sullivan (1842-1900) in 1871. The series of comic operettas they penned together - including H.M.S.

@499 Claude Debussy (1862-1918) composed the Petite suite (Little suite) for piano duet in 1888 when he was 26. He later arranged the solo version heard here (there also is an orchestral transcription by Henri Büsser). As with most of the composer's early compositions, there is a clarity of patterns and musical efficiency that shows the influence of the 18th century French clavecenists Couperin and Rameau. This suite, with its dance-like movements, especially shows this influence along with elements of the lyricism found in French operatic composers such as Gounod and Massenet. The first movement, En bateau (In a boat), has a gently swaying meter that gives the impression of a slowly rocking boat. The relaxing melody is gently supported by a harp-like broken chord accompaniment.

@500 Cortège (Procession), the animated second movement of Claude Debussy's Petite suite, suggests a procession of figurines following the striking of an ornate clock. The music is filled with rhythmically sparkling grace and delightful melodic turns. Debussy (1862-1918) composed the Petite suite (Little suite) for piano duet in 1888 when he was 26. He later arranged the solo version heard here (there also is an orchestral transcription by Henri Büsser). As with most of the composer's early compositions, there is a clarity of patterns and musical efficiency that shows the influence of the 18th century French clavecenists Couperin and Rameau. This suite, with its dance-like movements, especially shows this influence along with elements of the lyricism found in French operatic composers such as Gounod and Massenet.

@501 The gentle Menuet, which serves as the third movement of Claude Debussy's Petite suite, is a delicate tribute to the Baroque keyboard suite. Debussy (1862-1918) composed the Petite suite (Little suite) for piano duet in 1888 when he was 26. He later arranged the solo version heard here (there also is an orchestral transcription by Henri Büsser). As with most of the composer's early compositions, there is a clarity of patterns and musical efficiency that shows the influence of the 18th century French clavecenists Couperin and Rameau. This suite, with its dance-like movements, especially shows this influence along with elements of the lyricism found in French operatic composers such as Gounod and Massenet.

@502 The brilliant Ballet fourth movement concludes Debussy's Petit suite. It was written in a popular style and has the energy of a dancehall. There is an expressive Tempo di Valse in the middle and closing sections. Debussy (1862-1918) composed the Petite suite (Little suite) for piano duet in 1888 when he was 26. He later arranged the solo version heard here (there also is an orchestral transcription by Henri Büsser).

This suite, with its dance-like movements, especially shows this influence along with elements of the lyricism found in French operatic composers such as Gounod and Massenet.

@503 The eminent English composer John Ireland (1879-1962) wrote his London Pieces between 1917-20. They are three striking pictures of life in the great city. Chelsea Reach is the first in the set which includes Soho Forenoons and Ragamuffin (included in The Pianist). Ireland was a fine miniaturist, composing short works which sensitively conjure colorful images. The music is mildy modern with hints of English folk song. Chelsea Reach is a gentle and expressive Barcarolle. Slow moving chords suggest the movement of a large river approaching the sea.

@504 Antonin Dvorak (1841-1904) composed his eight Waltzes, Op. 54 between 1879-80. At this time in his life, he had become the most celebrated of Czech composers and was a professor of composition at the Prague Conservatory. Waltz No. 1 in A major has a sentimental moderato theme, interrupted by faster, contrasting sections. Dvorak also arranged this waltz for string quartet.

@505 Antonin Dvorak (1841-1904) composed his eight Waltzes, Op. 54 between 1879-80. At this time in his life, he had become the most celebrated of Czech composers and was a professor of composition at the Prague Conservatory. Waltz No. 2 in A minor is fast and furious, opening with a striking arpeggio theme in the right hand.

@506 Antonin Dvorak (1841-1904) composed his eight Waltzes, Op. 54 between 1879-80. At this time in his life, he had become the most celebrated of Czech composers and was a professor of composition at the Prague Conservatory. Waltz No. 3 in E major contrasts a rhythmically incisive opening theme with a delicate lyrical theme.

@507 Antonin Dvorak (1841-1904) composed his eight Waltzes, Op. 54 between 1879-80. At this time in his life, he had become the most celebrated of Czech composers and was a professor of composition at the Prague Conservatory. Waltz No. 4 in D-flat major openings surprisingly with a flute-like unaccompanied melody in the right hand. The simple opening rhythmic motif is briskly developed into a rousing waltz filled with contrast. Dvorak also arranged this waltz for string quartet.

@508 With Cat-Like Tread is from Gilbert & Sullivan's The Pirates of Penzance (1880). British playwright William Schwenck Gilbert (1836-1911) met composer Arthur Seymour Sullivan (1842-1900) in 1871. The series of comic operettas they penned together - including H.M.S. Pinafore (1878), The Pirates of Penzance, The Mikado (1885) and The Gondoliers (1889) - made their names household words to this day, whether it be Gilbert & Sullivan, or even simply "G & S".

Sullivan was actually a distinguished composer and conductor, producing many serious works including chamber music, operas and symphonic music.

@509 Behold the Lord High Executioner is from Gilbert & Sullivan's The Mikado (1885). The Mikado humorously shows a British view of Japanese culture at the end of the 19th century. British playwright William Schwenck Gilbert (1836-1911) met composer Arthur Seymour Sullivan (1842-1900) in 1871. The series of comic operettas they penned together - including H.M.S. Pinafore (1878), The Pirates of Penzance (1880), The Mikado and The Gondoliers (1889) - made their names household words to this day, whether it be Gilbert & Sullivan, or even simply "G & S".

@510 The Sun, Whose Rays from Gilbert & Sullivan's The Mikado (1885). The Mikado humorously shows a British view of Japanese culture at the end of the 19th century. British playwright William Schwenck Gilbert (1836-1911) met composer Arthur Seymour Sullivan (1842-1900) in 1871. The series of comic operettas they penned together - including H.M.S. Pinafore (1878), The Pirates of Penzance (1880), The Mikado and The Gondoliers (1889) - made their names household words to this day, whether it be Gilbert & Sullivan, or even simply "G & S".

@511 For He's Going to Marry Yum-Yum is from Gilbert & Sullivan's The Mikado (1885). The Mikado humorously shows a British view of Japanese culture at the end of the 19th century. British playwright William Schwenck Gilbert (1836-1911) met composer Arthur Seymour Sullivan (1842-1900) in 1871. The series of comic operettas they penned together - including H.M.S.

Sullivan was actually a distinguished composer and conductor, producing many serious works including chamber music, operas and symphonic music.

@512 French composer Léo Delibes (1836-91) had a major breakthrough in his career with his ballet Coppélia, or La fille aux yeux d'émail, which was performed at the Paris Opéra on May 2, 1870. Inspired by E.T.A. Hoffmann, it became one of the best loved classical ballets. This is the famous Valse lente from the ballet.

@513 Moritz Moszkowski (1854-1925) is most widely known for his Spanish Dances, Op. 12, originally composed for piano duet but, because of popular demand, arranged by the composer for piano solo (the solo version heard here). Moszkowski's salon music is well-crafted and requires an accurate, delicate technique for successful performance. In the early part of the twentieth century, almost everyone with a piano had a copy of the Spanish Dances. They were so popular that Moszkowski tried unsuccessfully to equal the success by composing more music from other lands, including his New Spanish Dances, Op. 65, and From Foreign Lands. Dance No. 1 in C major, simply marked Allegro brioso (fast and vigorous), is light and sparkling.

@514 One of Charles Gounod's (1818-93) most popular works is Ave Maria, which uses the first prelude from Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier, Book 1 as the accompaniment. It first appeared as the Méditation sur le premier prélude de piano de J.S. Bach for violin and piano (1853). It is often played in this solo piano arrangement.

@515 Moritz Moszkowski (1854-1925) is most widely known for his Spanish Dances, Op. 12, originally composed for piano duet but, because of popular demand, arranged by the composer for piano solo (the solo version heard here).

In the early part of the twentieth century, almost everyone with a piano had a copy of the Spanish Dances. They were so popular that Moszkowski tried unsuccessfully to equal the success by composing more music from other lands, including his New Spanish Dances, Op. 65, and From Foreign Lands. The set finishes with Dance No. 5 in D major, a spirited Bolero.

@516 Antonin Dvorak (1841-1904) composed his eight Waltzes, Op. 54 between 1879-80. At this time in his life, he had become the most celebrated of Czech composers and was a professor of composition at the Prague Conservatory. Waltz No. 5 in G minor seems to opening brightly in B-flat major, but quickly shows its sadder minor tonality. The waltz is an intriguing mix of harmony and tonality.

@517 Antonin Dvorak (1841-1904) composed his eight Waltzes, Op. 54 between 1879-80. At this time in his life, he had become the most celebrated of Czech composers and was a professor of composition at the Prague Conservatory. Waltz No. 6 in F major is rhythmically vigorous with lots of clever contrasts.

@518 Antonin Dvorak (1841-1904) composed his eight Waltzes, Op. 54 between 1879-80. At this time in his life, he had become the most celebrated of Czech composers and was a professor of composition at the Prague Conservatory. Waltz No. 7 in D minor is somewhat shorter than the rest of the set. Its opening theme moves smoothly in small steps giving the music a calm mood.

@519 Antonin Dvorak (1841-1904) composed his eight Waltzes, Op. 54 between 1879-80. At this time in his life, he had become the most celebrated of Czech composers and was a professor of composition at the Prague Conservatory. Waltz No. 8 in E-flat major is an energetic Allegro Vivace, ending the set with vigour!

@520 This transcription of Lohengrin's Verweis an Elsa (Lohengrin's Rebuke of Elsa) from Wagner's opera is by Franz Liszt. Liszt wrote the transcription in 1854. A gentle accompaniment of chords in triplet eighth notes supports the melody to which Liszt has included the words within the piano score. Lohengrin was first produced in Weimar in 1850 with Liszt himself conducting an orchestra of only 38 musicians. Wagner was in Switzerland at the time and did not attend a performance until 1861 in Vienna. As a master transcriber, Liszt (1811-86) produced piano versions of the symphonies, as well as works by many other composers, which are remarkably faithful to the originals. He wrote almost 400 piano transcriptions, arrangements, fantasies, paraphrases, variations, reminiscences, etc. They were a way of bringing infrequently performed orchestral works and the music of composers that he was championing to the public. They also were vehicles for his piano virtuosity. Liszt's paraphrases were freely composed works based usually on operatic melodies. In concerts, Liszt often performed the transcriptions before the public had even heard the original versions.

@521 The great operatic composer Giuseppe Verdi (1813-1901) composed Il trovatore (The Troubadour) from 1851-2, revising it in 1857. It is the story of rebellion of the Count of Urgel against the King of Aragon at the beginning of the 15th century in Spain. The Miserere is the scene for soprano Leonora, tenor Manrico and chorus in the fourth act of the opera. This is Franz Liszt's operatic paraphrase of the scene (composed in 1860). Liszt (1811-86) wrote almost 400 piano transcriptions, arrangements, fantasies, paraphrases, variations, reminiscences, etc. They were a way of bringing infrequently performed orchestral works and the music of composers that he was championing to the public. They also were vehicles for his piano virtuosity. Liszt's paraphrases were freely composed works based usually on operatic melodies.

@522 Domenico Scarlatti's (1685-1757) wrote over 500 keyboard sonatas, many stage works, and much church music. His music explored many new methods including hand crossing, rapid repetition of notes, and arpeggios traversing the length of the keyboard. His patrons included, at different times, the queens of Spain  and Poland.

@523 This is  the Romance from the opera La Pazza per Amore by French composer Nicolas-Marie Dalayrac (1753-1809). Dalayrac composed almost 60 comic operas that became very popular throughout France and Europe. 

@524 Franz Schubert's popular Marche Militaire in D major was composed in 1822 and first published as No. 1 in a set of 3 Marches Militaires for piano duet in 1826. This spectacular arrangement is by the Polish-born Carl Tausig (1841-71), Franz Liszt's favorite student and apparently a technically masterful pianist. In Germany, he was idolized not only as an amazing pianist but also as a great interpreter. He lives on in his superb piano transcriptions and paraphrases.

@525 Domenico Scarlatti's (1685-1757) wrote over 500 keyboard sonatas, many stage works, and much church music.

His patrons included, at different times, the queens of Spain  and Poland.


@526 Claude Debussy (1862-1918) composed the Six epigraphes antiques in 1914, as he was dying of cancer and depressed about the war. They were originally piano duets, although the composer made a solo piano arrangement in 1914. The first of the set, Pour invoquer Pan, dieu du vent d'été (For invoking Pan, God of the summer wind) is an exotic sounding pastorale. The music tries to evoke the feeling of apathy on a hot summer day. The structure of the movement is ABCBA.

@527 Pour un tombeau sans nom (For a tomb, without a name), the second of Claude Debussy's Six epigraphes antiques, is a slow and sombre elegy. Debussy (1862-1918) composed the Six epigraphes antiques in 1914, as he was dying of cancer and depressed about the war. They were originally piano duets, although the composer made a solo piano arrangement in 1914.

@528 Pour que la nuit soit propice (So that the night may be propitious), the third of Claude Debussy's Six epigraphes antiques, is a slow, expressive nocturne. An ostinato unifies the movement. Debussy (1862-1918) composed the Six epigraphes antiques in 1914, as he was dying of cancer and depressed about the war. They were originally piano duets, although the composer made a solo piano arrangement in 1914.

@529 Pour la danseuse aux crotales (For the dancer with rattles) is the fourth of Claude Debussy's Six epigraphes antiques. There are images of harps and te rattles of dancers in this supple movement. Debussy (1862-1918) composed the Six epigraphes antiques in 1914, as he was dying of cancer and depressed about the war. They were originally piano duets, although the composer made a solo piano arrangement in 1914.

@530 Pour l'Egyptienne (For the Egyptian), the fifth of Claude Debussy's Six epigraphes antiques, has elements of oriental exoticism and subtle variations in sound in different parts of the keyboard. Debussy (1862-1918) composed the Six epigraphes antiques in 1914, as he was dying of cancer and depressed about the war. They were originally piano duets, although the composer made a solo piano arrangement in 1914.

@531 Pour remercier la pluie au matin (For thanking the morning rain), the last of Claude Debussy's Six epigraphes antiques, is an animated, Impressionistic tone painting. An opening motif provides energy and unity for the whole movement. Debussy (1862-1918) composed the Six epigraphes antiques in 1914, as he was dying of cancer and depressed about the war. They were originally piano duets, although the composer made a solo piano arrangement in 1914.

@532 French composer Charles Gounod (1818-93) created his successful opera Faust in 1859, originally with spoken dialogue, and by 1869 evolving into a full-fledged opera with recitatives and ballet. This is Franz Liszt's concert paraphrase of the Waltz from Faust. Liszt (1811-86) wrote almost 400 piano transcriptions, arrangements, fantasies, paraphrases, variations, reminiscences, etc. They were a way of bringing infrequently performed orchestral works and the music of composers that Liszt was championing to the public. They also were vehicles for Liszt's piano virtuosity. Liszt's paraphrases were freely composed works based usually on operatic melodies.

@533 German composer Robert Franz (1815-1892) was a contemporary of Franz Liszt (1811-86). Although he assimilated the music of many composers into his style, he was most influenced by the lieder of Schumann and Schubert. Most of Franz's compositions are art songs such as Er ift gekommen in Sturm und Regen (He has come through storm and rain). Liszt, who championed the music of many of his contemporaries, wrote this piano transcription.

@534 Gioachino Rossini (1792-1868) had it all - prestige, wealth, popular acclaim and artistic influence. His contemporaries thought he was the greatest Italian composer of all time. Guillaume Tell (William Tell), based on a play by Schiller, was first performed in 1828 and was Rossini's last opera. Although he lived for another forty years, Rossini penned no more operas - probably a combination of being both tired of composing large scale works and comfortably rich. This is a piano solo arrangment of the well-known Overture to William Tell.

@535 This is a medley from Gilbert & Sullivan's H.M.S. Pinafore (1878). British playwright William Schwenck Gilbert (1836-1911) met composer Arthur Seymour Sullivan (1842-1900) in 1871. The series of comic operettas they penned together - including H.M.S. Pinafore, The Pirates of Penzance (1880), The Mikado (1885) and The Gondoliers (1889) - made their names household words to this day, whether it be Gilbert & Sullivan, or even simply "G & S". London's Savoy Theatre was actually built in 1881 to house the Gilbert & Sullivan productions. Gilbert had been a journalist and drama critic for various London periodicals. Sullivan was actually a distinguished composer and conductor, producing many serious works including chamber music, operas and symphonic music.

@536 This medley is taken from Gilbert & Sullivan's The Mikado (1885). The Mikado humorously shows a British view of Japanese culture at the end of the 19th century.

@537 Franz Joseph Haydn (1732-1809) composed a number of Trios for violin, cello and piano. The familiar last movement of Piano Trio No. 1 in G major has become known as the "Gipsy Rondo", heard here in a piano solo arrangement. The music is delightfully spirited.

@538 Liszt wrote this transcription of the Agnus Dei (Lamb of God) from Verdi's Requiem in 1877. The Requiem is the Roman Catholic Mass for the Dead. Many famous composers, such as Palestrina, Berlioz, Mozart and Fauré, have made elaborate musical settings. The great operatic composer Giuseppe Verdi (1813-1901) composed his great Requiem from 1873-4. As a master transcriber, Liszt (1811-86) produced piano versions of works by many other composers which are remarkably faithful to the originals. In concerts, Liszt often performed the transcriptions before the public had even heard the original versions.

@539 Johannes Brahms (1833-97) modelled his Liebesliederwalzer (Love-song waltzes), Op. 52 on the light-hearted Schubert Ländlers (a type of slow waltz originating in Austria's Landel). They appeared in 1869 for piano duet with optional (ad libitum) vocal quartet (soprano, alto, tenor & bass). The same set of eighteen waltzes were published without the vocal parts as Op. 52a. The verse for the waltzes are from the poem Polydora by Daumer. Waltz No. 3 in A major is also appears in the musical score in B-flat, presumably to accomodate the range of the singers available. The opening of the verse for this waltz follows in both German and the English translation: O die Frauen, o die Frauen, Wie sie Wonne thauen! Wäre lang ein Mönch geworden, Wären nicht die Frauen. (O women, how they delight and melt the heart; were it not for women, I should long since have become a monk.)
