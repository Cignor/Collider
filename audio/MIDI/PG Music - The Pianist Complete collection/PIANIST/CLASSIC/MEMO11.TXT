@835 Liszt described the second movement of Beethoven's Piano Sonata C-sharp minor, Op.27, No.2 as "a flower between two abysses." Marked Allegretto, it is a scherzo with minuet-like grace (or perhaps the other way around?) with a classic trio, both in D-flat major.

Beethoven composed this famous sonata in 1801. It is named Sonata quasi una Fantasia, like its sister sonata, Op.27, No.1. Beethoven's dedication to Giulietta Guicciardi was apparently transfered at the last minute to this work from the Rondo in G, Op.51, No.2, so probably the sonata is not an indication of love to this 16 year old pupil as has been speculated. Both sonatas in Op.27, as well as the three sonatas of Op.26 were published together by Cappi of Vienna in 1802. The nickname "moonlight" was given to the work by the poet/musician Heinrich F.L. Rellstab, then a critic in Berlin, around 1832 and borrowed by the publisher. Rellstab claimed the title was prompted by the vision "of a boat on Lake Lucerne by a luminous night." According to Czerny, Beethoven resented the popularity of this sonata. "Everyone is always talking about the C-sharp minor sonata! Surely I have written better things." There was even a performance by Liszt in Paris in 1835 in which the pianist played the second and third movements, and an orchestra played the first. The Adagio sostenuto first movement is not in traditional sonata form. Beethoven writes that "This whole piece must be played very delicately and with pedal." As David Dubal writes, "The first movement was truly something new, the emotion expressed having nothing in common with anything written previously." This sonata is considered to be from Beethoven's Second Period of composition in which he tried to expand the dimensions and form of the sonata without being restricted to classical convention.

@836 The finale of Beethoven's Piano Sonata C-sharp minor, Op.27, No.2 is a stormy and tragic Presto agitato. David Dubal calls it "surely the wildest music of the time, with its heated and frenzied upward arpeggio theme." It written is in sonata form and was the longest last movement Beethoven had yet produced.

@837 The Sonata in D, Op.28 has been nicknamed the Pastorale, although this was not Beethoven's title. The name appeared in an English edition (Broderip & Wilkinson) about three years after the original edition published by Bureau of Vienna in 1802. It was composed in 1801 and dedicated to Joseph Edlem von Sonnenfels. Perhaps its mood matches something that Beethoven once wrote in a happy moment of his life, "In the country it seems as if every tree said to me: 'Holy! Holy!' Nature is a glorious school for the heart."  This sonata is considered to be from Beethoven's Second Period of composition in which he tried to expand the dimensions and form of the sonata without being restricted to classical convention.

@841 Beethoven's Piano Sonata in G, Op.31, No.1 is one of his least played works, although it deserves better. The Allegro vivace first movement is bold and clever, filled with humor and spark that shows Beethoven's new positive attitude after having contemplated suicide and written his famous Heiligenstadt testament.

This sonata is one of Beethoven's least played works, although it deserves more frequent performance. It was composed from 1801-2 and first published by Nägeli of Zürich in 1804 (Nägeli actually inserted four extra measures in the first movement after bar 298, much to Beethoven's anger). A dedication to Anna Margarete von Browne, a pupil of Beethoven's and wife of Count von Browne-Camus, appeared in 1805 when the three sonatas of Op.31 were published together by Cappi in Vienna.

@842 The Adagio grazioso second movement of Beethoven's Piano Sonata in G, Op.31, No.1 is long (119 measures) and difficult to sustain. It features two cadenzas as well as many delicate effects which perhaps show Beethoven trying to take advantage of newly developed improvements in the mechanical actions of pianos. Alfred Brendel wrote that this movement is "like an ironic comment on something old-fashioned.... There is a mixture of love and irony that is very strange and if the player can manage to convey it, it can be very effective."

@844 The slow introductory motifs in the first movement of Beethoven's Piano Sonata in D minor, Op.31, No.2 are like the calm before the stormy Allegros. The use of keys is very unusual. The first Largo introduction is built on the A major dominant, and then on a C major chord before D minor is clearly established at measure 21. The movement has a dark and agitated mood which suits its nickname of The Tempest.

The sonata became known as Gespinnste (The Tempest) because of the composer's reported response to Schindler about its meaning, "Just read Shakespeare's Tempest".

@855 The Piano Sonata in C, Op.53 (Waldstein) is one of Beethoven's greatest masterpieces. It is on much grander scale than any of Beethoven's previous sonatas. From the performer, it demands technical brilliance and rhythmic control of its large structure. The sonata was composed during a happy and untroubled part of Beethoven's life. In a letter to his student Ries, Beethoven wrote "For the life of me I should never have thought that I could be so lazy as I am here. If an outbreak of really hard work is going to follow, then indeed something fine may be the result." The sonata was composed from 1803-04 and first published by Bureau of Vienna in 1805. The nickname Waldstein is derived from its dedication to Count von Waldstein, Beethoven's musical friend and a benefactor since his early Bonn years. The range of notes in this sonata is greater than in previous works as Beethoven took advantage of the enlarged keyboard on the piano given to him in 1803 by the Erard piano company. The sonata later became known as "Aurore." This sonata is considered to be from Beethoven's Second Period of composition in which he tried to expand the dimensions and form of the sonata without being restricted to classical convention.

Apparently, Beethoven originally wrote a much longer middle movement but discarded it on the advice of a friend. That movement was published as the Andante Favori in F, WoO 57. In any event, the Rondo should proceed from this movement without a break.

@867 The Piano Sonata in E-flat, Op.81a (Les adieux) is Beethoven's only sonata intended to suggest extramusical ideas. On May 4, 1809, Napolean's armies marched on Vienna, and the court, including the Beethoven's friend, student and patron, the Archduke Rudolph of Austria, fled the city and took refuge at Breda. The three movements in turn depict the Archduke's departure, his absence and his return. The sonata is not only dedicated to the Archduke, but Beethoven's unpublished dedication, written only in the manuscript sketches, says "written from the heart and dedicated to H.R.H." It was first published by Clementi of London in 1811. This sonata is considered to be from Beethoven's Second Period of composition in which he tried to expand the dimensions and form of the sonata without being restricted to classical convention.

The first movement is called Das Lebewohl (Les Adieux or Fare thee well) and the title includes the note "The farewell Vienna, May 4th, 1809, on the occasion of His Imperial Highness, the revered Archduke Rudolf's departure". Beethoven actually writes "Le-be-wohl" over the opening three chord motif. The motif begins the brief Adagio introduction which leads into an Allegro in sonata form.

@868 The short second movement of Beethoven's Piano Sonata in E-flat, Op.81a is titled Abwesenheit (L'absence). It is a sad, wistful Andante espressivo that leads directly into the next movement without a break.

The final movement is called Das Wiedersehen (Le Retour) or "The arrival (return) of His Imperial Highness the revered Archduke Rudolf on January 30th, 1810". It is marked Vivacissimamente and expresses both joy and triumph. The writing is brilliant.

This is Beethoven's only sonata intended to suggest extramusical ideas. On May 4, 1809, Napolean's armies marched on Vienna, and the court, including the Beethoven's friend, student and patron, the Archduke Rudolph of Austria, fled the city and took refuge at Breda. The three movements in turn depict the Archduke's departure, his absence and his return. The sonata is not only dedicated to the Archduke, but Beethoven's unpublished dedication, written only in the manuscript sketches, says "written from the heart and dedicated to H.R.H."

@869 Beethoven's Piano Sonata in E minor, Op.90 was dedicated to his patron Count Moritz Lichnowsky in honor of his engagement. Tovey reported that Beethoven called the first movement "a contest between head and heart", apparently joking about what must be happening to the Count. Beethoven's performance instructions in German are "Mit Lebhaftigkeit und durchaus mit Empfindung und Ausdruck" (with liveliness and absolutely with emotion and expression). It was becoming the fashion in Germany at the time to avoid Italian musical terms in favor of German, since Italian was considered Napoleonic.

The sonata was composed in 1814 and first published by Steiner of Vienna in 1815. Beethoven was by this time almost totally deaf. However, the mood of this lovely work, while somewhat introspective, is hardly as dark as some might expect. It is considered the last of his Second Period sonatas. In his Second Period of composition, Beethoven tried to expand the dimensions and form of the sonata without being restricted to classical convention.

@870 In the second movement of Beethoven's Piano Sonata in E minor, Op.90, the innocent lyricism of this E major Rondo is in sharp contrast with the opening movement in E minor. Beethoven indicates "Nicht zu geschwind und sehr singbar vorgetragen" (Not too fast and with a singing melody). His unofficial title for the Rondo was "Happy Conversation with the Beloved." David Dubal calls the movement "a quest for purity and peace."

@871 The first movement of the Piano Sonata in A, Op.101 is the shortest in Beethoven's career but it is the introduction to one of the greatest piano masterpieces. David Dubal thinks it has "an indescribable yearning, an almost Wagnerian melos." Beethoven instructs the performer, Etwas lebhaft und mit der innigsten Empfindung (somewhat lively and with tender emotion).

This sonata was composed in 1816 and dedicated to Baroness Dorothea von Ertmann, a student of Beethoven and a distinguished pianist. It was first published by Steiner of Vienna in 1817. This is the first sonata which Beethoven titled "Für das Hammerklavier" rather than for "Pianoforte". It was an attempt to be consistent with his performance instructions which were now being written in German. Beethoven's final five piano sonatas, composed from 1816-22 and beginning with this one, are considered to be part of his Late (third) Period of creativity. They are the peak of his sonata writing and, in the words of James Friskin, present "the most profound and subtle interpretative problems encountered in the work of any composer for the pianoforte. The musical ideas themselves are invested with a depth of emotion and almost prophetic exaltation that ask for exceptional qualities of dedication and musical insight, if any adequate performance is to be attained." Op.101 shows a remarkable cohesiveness of idea and expression. John Gillespie thinks it "so completely disregards standard form that it almost seems a work of fantasy -- fantasy in the best sense of the word."

@872 For the second movement of his Piano Sonata in A, Op.101, Beethoven replaces the usual scherzo in 3/4 time with what he describes as Lebhaft, Marschmässig (lively, rather march-like). The vigorous, powerful march in F major is contrasted with gentle, lyrical section in B-flat, before a Da Capo of the March without repetition. In effect, the music functions like a scherzo and trio.

@873 It is possible to look at the conclusion of Beethoven's Piano Sonata in A, Op.101 in two ways: either there is a short slow movement which continues into the final Allegro movement without interruption, or there is simply a third movement with a slow introduction. Either way, the Langsam und sehnsuchtsvoll (slow and filled with yearning) movement, with its brief cadenza and then a quote from the opening of the first movement, is preparation for the magnificent countrapuntal writing of the Allegro. The Allegro is actually in sonata form with a fugue in its development section.

@874 Beethoven's Piano Sonata in B-flat, Op.106 (Hammer-klavier) is one of the most monumental works of music ever created. It is the longest and most difficult of the sonatas, taking some forty-five minutes to perform, and seemingly pitting the performer against the forces of nature themselves. It was composed from 1817-18, first published by Artaria of Vienna in 1819, and dedicated to the Archduke Rudolph. Beethoven was well aware of its challenges when he wrote to his publisher Artaria, "Now you have a sonata that will keep the pianists busy when it is played fifty years hence!" It has come to be known as the Hammer-klavier after its title Grosse Sonate für das Hammer-klavier, which really just means Large Sonata for the Piano. This was simply indicative of Beethoven's recent use of his native German for performance instructions. The previous sonata, Op.101, was also titled Für das Hammerklavier. Charles Rosen wrote that "with this work, the emancipation of piano music from the demands of the amateur musician was made official, with a consequent loss of responsibility and a greater freedom for the imagination." This sonata is from Beethoven's Final Period of composition where he subjects sonata form to the remarkable imagination of his mature musicianship.

The magnificent opening Allegro movement in sonata form has two contrasting themes in the exposition (which is repeated). The contrapuntal development section is breathtaking. Its technical difficulties are considerable.

@875 The second movement of Beethoven's Piano Sonata in B-flat, Op.106 (Hammer-klavier) is in classic scherzo-trio-da capo form, although there is a Presto and short Prestissimo section with a brief cadenza before the repeat of the scherzo.

@876 The third movement of the Piano Sonata in B-flat, Op.106 (Hammer-klavier) is the longest adagio of Beethoven's sonatas (187 measures) and perhaps in all the piano repertory. It is also one of the most sublime creations in all of music, filled with great expression and patient reflection. It should be noted that the first measure, consisting of just A and C-sharp in octaves, was added later by Beethoven. The movement is marked Adagio sostenuto: Appassionato e con molto sentimento.

@877 The final movement of the Piano Sonata in B-flat, Op.106 (Hammer-klavier) begins with an improvisatory introduction which leads to what Beethoven describes as a Fugue a tre voci, con alcune licenze (rather free three-part fugue). What an enormous, musically and technically difficult fugue it is! Its effect on listeners even today is startling. In Beethoven's time, many may have dismissed it as the ramblings of a madman and most certainly unplayable. Indeed, there are few contemporary pianists who would hazzard to include Op.106 in their repertory. As Friskin points out, "The combined musical and technical demands of this sonata make the most exacting of all tasks that a pianist can undertake. The difficulty for the listener is no less." The movement ends with a grand flourish.

@878 Beethoven's Piano Sonata in E, Op.109 opens with a concise movement in sonata form which presents a contrast between two characters. Although marked Vivace, ma non troppo, the light texture of the innocent opening theme unfolds with leisure until it is abruptly juxtaposed with Adagio espressivo passages. The coda presents the opening theme, subdued and with subtle shifts between major and minor.

The sonata was composed in 1820 and first published by Schlesinger, Berlin in 1821. It was dedicated to Maximiliane Brentano. Compared with the war against nature that Beethoven fought in Op.106, the Op.109 is a work of subtlety and warm lyricism.

@879 The Prestissimo second movement of Beethoven's Piano Sonata in E, Op.109 is what Alfred Brendel referred to when he called the work "an angel with a demon in its middle."

@880 Beethoven's Piano Sonata in E, Op.109 and his last sonata, Op.111, both end with slow theme and variations. This is a long way from the early Haydnesque sonatas of Op.2. Op.109 is the first time that Beethoven has tried this. The theme is irresistibly warm and lyrical. The six variations are beautifully rich and varied. The final variation has the extended trills that one finds in the late sonatas. The opening theme returns to end the work with serenity.

@881 Beethoven's Piano Sonata in A-flat, Op.110 is one of his most expressive and heart warming creations. The first movement is marked Moderato cantabile molto espressivo. It is in sonata form treated with great liberty. It unfolds with leisure. The themes are in singing style except for one built on a delicate arpeggio figure.

The sonata was composed in 1821 and first published by Schlesinger of Paris in 1822. There is no known dedication. John Gillespie calls it "one of Beethoven's most astonishingly expressive works. It contains the ultimate essentials of his mature characteristics: expansive developments; liberty in form; a transformation of the Classic sonata framework by the introduction of the dramatic recitative and the fugue; and finally, a thematic similarity, or rather a genesis of themes from an initial theme."

@882 The second movement of Beethoven's Piano Sonata in A-flat, Op.110 is a a vigorous scherzo in 2/4 time. The Allegro molto scherzo in F minor is constructed mainly in four part chords with sharp dynamic contrasts and accents. The trio section in D-flat pits scampering legato eighth notes in the right hand against terse quarter notes in the left hand played mainly on the off beats. A brief coda slows the pace and introduces the slow movement.

@883 Typical of the late Beethoven sonatas is the blurring of dividing lines between individual movements. In the Piano Sonata in A-flat, Op.110, the third movement serves to introduce the fourth movement fugue. It is operatic, beginning like a recitative and then, after a brief Adagio ma non troppo passage which establishes a triplet chordal accompaniment, unveils a tormented arioso melody which Beethoven calls Klagender Gesang (Wailing song).

After it runs its course, there is a transition back to the arioso Wailing song of the third movement.

@885 The opening of Beethoven's Piano Sonata in C minor, Op.111 has a ferocity rarely encountered in music. The first movement is experienced on all levels, from passion and drama, to thoughtful reflection, and intellectually in the form of a remarkable sonata structure that includes counterpoint in its arsenal.

The last of Beethoven's 32 piano sonatas, Op.111 is a distillation of the composer's musical and emotional growth. This magnificent work seems to reach towards things beyond verbal description. It was composed from 1821-22 and first published by Schlesinger of Paris in 1823. It is fittingly dedicated to the Beethoven's longtime friend, student and patron, the Archduke Rudolph of Austria. Denis Matthews writes "there are only two movements and they make their contrast at all possible levels: Allegro con brio ed appassionata and Adagio molto semplice e cantabile, sonata form and variation form, extreme tubulence and profound serenity, the material and the spiritual worlds, the minor and the major key. Was this then the ultimate solution to the unity of the sonata, the resolving in one movement of the problems of the other?"

But unlike the contrasts in the Op.109 variations, this Arietta movement unfolds with the patterns of each succeeding variation becoming increasingly amplified.
