Great questions! Let me explain Git and GitHub workflow in a practical way for your project.

## **Basic Git Workflow** üîÑ

### **Daily Work Cycle:**

```powershell
# 1. Check what files changed
git status

# 2. Add files you want to commit
git add file1.cpp file2.h         # Specific files
git add juce/Source/audio/        # Entire directory
git add .                          # Everything (be careful!)

# 3. Commit with a meaningful message
git commit -m "Add multi-band shaper distortion modes"

# 4. Push to GitHub
git push
```

## **When to Commit?** ‚è∞

**Commit when you:**
- ‚úÖ **Complete a feature** - "Added reverb module"
- ‚úÖ **Fix a bug** - "Fixed audio glitch in delay module"
- ‚úÖ **Reach a stable point** - "Refactored EQ processor for clarity"
- ‚úÖ **End your work session** - Even if incomplete
- ‚úÖ **Before trying something risky** - Safety checkpoint!

**Don't commit:**
- ‚ùå Broken/non-compiling code (unless it's end of day)
- ‚ùå Every single line change
- ‚ùå Generated files (build artifacts, logs)

---

## **How Often to Push to GitHub?** üì§

### **Recommended Schedule:**

| **Frequency** | **When** | **Why** |
|---------------|----------|---------|
| **At least daily** | End of coding session | Backup your work |
| **After major features** | New module completed | Save milestones |
| **Before risky changes** | Experimenting | Safety net |
| **Multiple times a day** | If actively developing | Collaborate & backup |

**My recommendation for your project:** Push **at least once per day**, and push immediately after completing any major feature or module.

---

## **Good Commit Messages** üìù

### **Bad vs Good:**

‚ùå **Bad:**
```bash
git commit -m "updates"
git commit -m "fixed stuff"
git commit -m "changes"
```

‚úÖ **Good:**
```bash
git commit -m "Add waveshaper module with multiple distortion modes"
git commit -m "Fix frequency graph rendering performance issue"
git commit -m "Refactor RandomModule parameter handling"
git commit -m "Update GraphicEQ to support 10-band mode"
```

### **Format I recommend:**
```
[Type] Brief description

Longer explanation if needed
- What changed
- Why it changed
```

**Example:**
```bash
git commit -m "Add MultiBandShaper distortion module

- Implemented 3-band crossover filtering
- Added 5 distortion algorithms per band
- Created parameter management system"
```

---

## **Practical Commands for Your Daily Work**

### **1. See what you've changed:**
```powershell
git status                    # What files changed
git diff                      # See actual changes
git diff juce/Source/audio/   # Changes in specific directory
```

### **2. Commit your work:**
```powershell
# Quick commit (for small changes)
git add .
git commit -m "Add quantizer module"
git push

# Careful commit (for larger changes)
git add juce/Source/audio/modules/NewModule.cpp
git add juce/Source/audio/modules/NewModule.h
git commit -m "Add new audio module with detailed description"
git push
```

### **3. View your history:**
```powershell
git log --oneline              # See commit history
git log --oneline -10          # Last 10 commits
git log --graph --oneline      # Visual graph
```

### **4. Undo mistakes:**
```powershell
# Undo changes to a file (before commit)
git checkout -- filename.cpp

# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset HEAD~1

# Discard all local changes (CAREFUL!)
git reset --hard HEAD
```

---

## **Recommended Workflow for Your Project** üéØ

### **Daily Routine:**

**Morning:**
```powershell
git status    # See if you have uncommitted work from yesterday
```

**During Development:**
```powershell
# Every time you complete something meaningful:
git add juce/Source/audio/modules/YourModule.cpp
git commit -m "Descriptive message about what you did"
```

**End of Day:**
```powershell
git status                           # Check what's uncommitted
git add .                            # Add everything
git commit -m "End of day - work in progress on [feature]"
git push                             # Backup to GitHub
```

---

## **Advanced: Branching (Optional but Recommended)** üåø

Branches let you experiment without breaking your main code:

```powershell
# Create a new branch for a feature
git checkout -b feature/new-filter-module

# Work on it, commit as usual
git add .
git commit -m "Add new filter"

# When done, merge back to main
git checkout main
git merge feature/new-filter-module

# Push everything
git push
```

**Use branches for:**
- Big experiments
- New major features
- Testing risky changes

---

## **Quick Reference Cheat Sheet** üìã

```powershell
# Most used commands:
git status                    # What changed?
git add .                     # Stage all changes
git commit -m "Message"       # Save changes locally
git push                      # Upload to GitHub

# Useful commands:
git log --oneline            # See history
git diff                     # See changes
git pull                     # Download from GitHub

# Safety commands:
git stash                    # Temporarily save changes
git stash pop                # Restore stashed changes
```

---

## **My Specific Recommendation for You** üí°

Based on your synthesizer project:

1. **Commit after each module is working** - "Add RandomModule", "Add GraphicEQ", etc.
2. **Push to GitHub every evening** - Your work is backed up
3. **Use descriptive messages** - Future you will thank you
4. **Don't worry about perfect commits** - Just commit regularly!

### **Example Daily Workflow:**
```powershell
# Morning - check status
git status

# Working - commit when you finish something
git add juce/Source/audio/modules/NewModule.*
git commit -m "Implement NewModule with feature X"

# Lunch break - quick backup
git add .
git commit -m "WIP: halfway through feature X"
git push

# Evening - final push
git add .
git commit -m "Complete NewModule implementation"
git push
```

---

## **Pro Tips** üåü

1. **Commit often** - Better too many commits than too few
2. **Push daily** - GitHub is your backup
3. **Write clear messages** - Help future you
4. **Don't commit build outputs** - `.gitignore` handles this
5. **Experiment in branches** - Keep main stable

Great question! Here's how to **time travel** with Git when your code goes wrong:

---

## **Step 1: Find the Good Commit** üîç

First, see your commit history:

```powershell
# Simple list
git log --oneline

# Last 10 commits
git log --oneline -10

# More detailed with dates
git log --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s"
```

**Output looks like:**
```
7d864ecb9 - Monsieur Pimpant, 5 minutes ago : Audio modules: updates
c1ba9db0a - Monsieur Pimpant, 2 hours ago : Initial commit
```

The hash (e.g., `7d864ecb9`) is your commit ID.

---

## **Option 1: Just Look at Old Code (Safe)** üëÄ

**Don't change anything, just peek:**

```powershell
# Go back to a specific commit (read-only)
git checkout 7d864ecb9

# Look around, read files, test compile...
# Nothing you do here is saved

# Come back to present
git checkout main
```

‚úÖ **Safest option** - just browsing history  
‚ùå Can't make changes that stick

---

## **Option 2: Temporarily Go Back (Stash Current Work)** üíæ

**Keep your current work but test old code:**

```powershell
# Save your current changes
git stash save "My current messy code"

# Go to old commit
git checkout 7d864ecb9

# Test it, verify it works...

# Come back to present
git checkout main

# Restore your work
git stash pop
```

‚úÖ Your current work is saved  
‚úÖ Can switch between versions  
‚úÖ Doesn't lose anything

---

## **Option 3: Hard Reset (Destructive!)** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Throw away current code, go back permanently:**

```powershell
# Find the good commit
git log --oneline

# DANGER: This deletes all changes after that commit!
git reset --hard 7d864ecb9

# Everything after that commit is GONE
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **PERMANENT** - Can't undo easily  
‚úÖ Clean slate from that point  
‚ùå Loses all work after that commit

---

## **Option 4: Soft Reset (Keep Your Changes)** üîÑ

**Go back but keep your files as "uncommitted":**

```powershell
# Go back but keep all your file changes
git reset --soft 7d864ecb9

# Your files still have all the changes
# But the commits after 7d864ecb9 are undone

# You can now recommit differently
git commit -m "New approach"
```

‚úÖ Keeps your file changes  
‚úÖ Just removes bad commits  
‚úÖ Can recommit better

---

## **Option 5: Revert (Create New Commit)** ‚Ü©Ô∏è

**Undo a commit by creating an "opposite" commit:**

```powershell
# Undo the last commit (but keep history)
git revert HEAD

# Undo a specific commit
git revert 7d864ecb9

# This creates a NEW commit that undoes the changes
```

‚úÖ Keeps full history  
‚úÖ Safe for shared repositories  
‚úÖ No data loss

---

## **Practical Scenarios for You** üéØ

### **Scenario 1: "I just broke everything!"**

```powershell
# See what you changed
git status
git diff

# Throw away ALL uncommitted changes (CAREFUL!)
git checkout .

# OR throw away just one file
git checkout -- juce/Source/audio/modules/BrokenModule.cpp
```

---

### **Scenario 2: "My last commit was terrible"**

```powershell
# Undo last commit, keep changes as uncommitted
git reset HEAD~1

# Fix your code...

# Commit it properly
git commit -m "Fixed version"
```

---

### **Scenario 3: "I need yesterday's working version"**

```powershell
# See recent commits
git log --oneline -10

# Find yesterday's commit (e.g., c1ba9db0a)
# Create a new branch from it
git checkout -b working-version c1ba9db0a

# Now you're on a branch at that point in time
# Your main branch is untouched
```

---

### **Scenario 4: "Everything is broken, nuclear option"**

```powershell
# Get the EXACT code from GitHub (destroy local changes)
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main

# This makes your local code identical to GitHub
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **NUCLEAR** - Destroys all local changes!

---

## **My Recommendation for Your Project** üí°

### **Daily Safety Workflow:**

**Before trying something risky:**
```powershell
# Create a safety branch
git checkout -b experiment-crazy-feature

# Work on your experiment...

# If it works great:
git checkout main
git merge experiment-crazy-feature

# If it fails:
git checkout main
git branch -D experiment-crazy-feature  # Delete the experiment
```

### **"Oh no!" Recovery:**

**If you realize you broke something:**
```powershell
# 1. See what changed
git status

# 2. Throw away changes to specific files
git checkout -- filename.cpp

# 3. Or throw away everything uncommitted
git reset --hard HEAD

# 4. Or go back to yesterday's commit
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Go back 1 commit
```

---

## **Visual Timeline Example** üìÖ

```
Current:    ‚Üí 7d864ecb9 (BAD CODE!)
Yesterday:  ‚Üí c1ba9db0a (GOOD CODE)
2 days ago: ‚Üí a1234567  (Also good)
```

**Different commands do different things:**

| Command | Result | What Happens |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| `git checkout c1ba9db0a` | Temporary view | Just looking, no changes |
| `git reset --hard c1ba9db0a` | Permanent rollback | **Deletes** 7d864ecb9 |
| `git reset --soft c1ba9db0a` | Undo commit | Keeps files, removes commit |
| `git revert 7d864ecb9` | New commit | Creates new commit undoing it |

---

## **Pro Tips** üåü

1. **Before any destructive command**, create a backup branch:
   ```powershell
   git branch backup-before-reset
   ```

2. **You can almost always recover** if you haven't pushed:
   ```powershell
   git reflog  # Shows ALL history, even deleted commits
   ```

3. **GitHub is your safety net** - If you pushed before breaking things:
   ```powershell
   git reset --hard origin/main  # Back to GitHub version
   ```

4. **Test before committing**:
   ```powershell
   # See what will be committed
   git diff --staged
   ```

---

## **Quick Recovery Cheat Sheet** üÜò

```powershell
# Undo uncommitted changes
git checkout .                    # All files
git checkout -- filename.cpp      # One file

# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset HEAD~1

# Undo last commit (delete changes)
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Go back to GitHub version
git reset --hard origin/main

# View history to find good commit
git log --oneline -20

# Create safety branch before experiment
git checkout -b experiment

# Emergency: show me ALL commits (even deleted)
git reflog
```

---

**Bottom line:** Git is like a time machine for your code. Almost nothing is truly lost unless you force-push to GitHub. The key is knowing which command fits your situation!
