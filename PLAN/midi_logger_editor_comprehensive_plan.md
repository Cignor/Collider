# MIDI Logger & Editor Comprehensive Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the transformation of `MidiLoggerModuleProcessor` into a truly polyvalent MIDI logger and editor, or alternatively, the creation of a dedicated MIDI Editor node. The goal is to provide professional-grade MIDI recording, editing, and playback capabilities within the modular synth environment.

**Decision Point**: Extend existing `MidiLoggerModuleProcessor` vs. Create new `MidiEditorModuleProcessor`

---

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Features (MidiLoggerModuleProcessor)
✅ **Recording**
- Records MIDI from CV inputs (Gate, Pitch, Velocity) per track
- Sample-accurate timing (stores in samples)
- Multi-track support (up to 12 tracks)
- Legato pitch change detection
- Thread-safe event storage with ReadWriteLock

✅ **Playback**
- Playback with looping (configurable loop length in bars)
- CV outputs per track (Gate, Pitch, Velocity)
- MIDI output to VSTi plugins and external devices
- BPM sync from transport

✅ **UI**
- Piano roll visualization with timeline ruler
- Multi-track stacked view
- Note dragging (time position only)
- Right-click erase
- Zoom controls
- Click-to-seek timeline

✅ **File I/O**
- Export to MIDI file (.mid)
- Saves tempo, time signature, track names

### Limitations & Gaps
❌ **Editing Capabilities**
- Can only drag notes horizontally (time position)
- Cannot resize note durations
- Cannot edit pitch/velocity directly
- No copy/paste/duplicate operations
- No quantization tools
- No undo/redo system
- No selection/multi-select
- No grid snapping

❌ **MIDI Features**
- No MIDI CC (Control Change) support
- No pitch bend recording/editing
- No aftertouch support
- No program change
- No MIDI file import (only export)
- No MIDI channel assignment per track

❌ **Advanced Editing**
- No note velocity editing (visual or numeric)
- No note length editing (resize handles)
- No transposition tools
- No scale quantization
- No humanization/randomization
- No pattern/loop editing

❌ **Workflow**
- No undo/redo
- No clipboard operations
- No track duplication
- No track merging/splitting
- No time signature changes
- No tempo changes within sequence

## Architecture Decision: Extend vs. New Module

### Option A: Extend MidiLoggerModuleProcessor
**Pros:**
- Preserves existing user workflows
- Single module for recording + editing
- Less code duplication
- Existing state management in place

**Cons:**
- Risk of feature bloat
- Harder to maintain clean separation of concerns
- May confuse users (is it a logger or editor?)
- Performance concerns (always running editor code)

### Option B: Create Separate MidiEditorModuleProcessor
**Pros:**
- Clear separation: Logger = record, Editor = edit
- Can optimize each for its purpose
- Users can have multiple editors for different sequences
- Cleaner architecture
- Can load/edit external MIDI files independently

**Cons:**
- Need to transfer data between modules
- More modules to maintain
- Potential confusion about which to use

### Option C: Hybrid Approach (RECOMMENDED)
**Keep MidiLoggerModuleProcessor** for recording and basic playback
**Create MidiEditorModuleProcessor** for advanced editing

**Workflow:**
1. Record in MidiLogger → Export to .mid
2. Load .mid in MidiEditor → Edit → Export back
3. OR: MidiEditor can directly load from MidiLogger's memory (shared state)

**Benefits:**
- Best of both worlds
- Clear separation of concerns
- Can use editor without recording
- Can edit external MIDI files
- Logger stays lightweight for real-time recording

## Technical Architecture

### Data Structure Design

#### Current Structure (MidiLoggerModuleProcessor)
```cpp
struct MidiEvent {
    int pitch;
    float velocity;
    int64_t startTimeInSamples;
    int64_t durationInSamples;
};
```

#### Proposed Enhanced Structure (MidiEditorModuleProcessor)
```cpp
struct MidiNote {
    int pitch = 60;
    int velocity = 100;  // 0-127, not normalized
    double startTime = 0.0;  // In beats/ticks, not samples
    double duration = 0.0;   // In beats/ticks
    int trackIndex = 0;
    int midiChannel = 1;  // 1-16
    juce::Uuid id;  // Unique ID for selection/undo
};

struct MidiCCEvent {
    int ccNumber = 1;  // 0-127
    int value = 0;     // 0-127
    double time = 0.0;
    int trackIndex = 0;
    int midiChannel = 1;
};

struct MidiTrack {
    juce::String name;
    juce::Colour color;
    int midiChannel = 1;
    bool muted = false;
    bool soloed = false;
    
    std::vector<MidiNote> notes;
    std::vector<MidiCCEvent> ccEvents;
    std::vector<PitchBendEvent> pitchBendEvents;
    
    // Thread safety
    mutable juce::ReadWriteLock lock;
};
```

**Key Differences:**
- Time stored in beats/ticks (not samples) for musical precision
- Velocity as integer (0-127) matching MIDI standard
- Unique IDs for undo/redo
- Support for CC, pitch bend, etc.

### Undo/Redo System

#### Command Pattern Implementation
```cpp
class MidiEditCommand {
public:
    virtual ~MidiEditCommand() = default;
    virtual void execute() = 0;
    virtual void undo() = 0;
    virtual juce::String getDescription() const = 0;
};

class UndoManager {
    std::vector<std::unique_ptr<MidiEditCommand>> undoStack;
    std::vector<std::unique_ptr<MidiEditCommand>> redoStack;
    size_t maxUndoLevels = 100;
    
public:
    void executeCommand(std::unique_ptr<MidiEditCommand> cmd);
    void undo();
    void redo();
    bool canUndo() const;
    bool canRedo() const;
};
```

**Command Types:**
- `AddNoteCommand`
- `DeleteNoteCommand`
- `MoveNoteCommand`
- `ResizeNoteCommand`
- `ChangeVelocityCommand`
- `TransposeCommand`
- `QuantizeCommand`
- `PasteCommand`

### Thread Safety Model

#### Current Model (MidiLogger)
- Audio thread: Writes to `activeNotes` map, then creates `MidiEvent`
- UI thread: Reads via `getEventsCopy()` (ReadWriteLock)
- UI thread: Writes via `setEvents()` (WriteLock)

#### Proposed Model (MidiEditor)
- **Audio thread**: Read-only access for playback
- **UI thread**: Full read/write access for editing
- **Synchronization**: 
  - Double-buffered event lists (swap on commit)
  - Atomic flags for "dirty" state
  - Message queue for audio thread updates

```cpp
class MidiEditorData {
    // Active data (for audio thread playback)
    std::vector<MidiTrack> activeTracks;
    juce::CriticalSection activeLock;
    
    // Editing data (for UI thread)
    std::vector<MidiTrack> editingTracks;
    juce::CriticalSection editingLock;
    
    // Commit changes from editing → active
    void commitChanges() {
        juce::ScopedLock lock1(editingLock);
        juce::ScopedLock lock2(activeLock);
        activeTracks = editingTracks;  // Deep copy
    }
};
```

### MIDI File Format Support

#### Import Requirements
- Standard MIDI File (SMF) format 0, 1
- Multiple tracks
- Tempo meta events
- Time signature meta events
- Track names
- MIDI channels
- Note on/off
- CC events
- Pitch bend
- Program change

#### Export Requirements
- All import features
- Preserve editing metadata (if any)
- Option to export selected tracks only
- Option to merge tracks

### UI Architecture

#### Piano Roll Component
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Toolbar (tools, zoom, grid, snap)      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Timeline Ruler (bars, beats, ticks)     │
├──────┬──────────────────────────────────┤
│ Piano │ Piano Roll Area                 │
│ Keys  │ - Notes (rectangles)            │
│       │ - CC lanes (curves)            │
│       │ - Selection handles            │
│       │ - Playhead                     │
└──────┴──────────────────────────────────┘
│ Track List (names, mute, solo, color)   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Interaction Model
- **Tool Selection**: Pencil, Eraser, Select, Zoom
- **Note Creation**: Click in piano roll → create note
- **Note Editing**: 
  - Click note → select
  - Drag note → move (with grid snap)
  - Drag top/bottom → change pitch
  - Drag left/right edge → resize duration
  - Double-click → edit properties dialog
- **Selection**:
  - Click → single select
  - Shift+Click → add to selection
  - Drag → marquee select
  - Ctrl+A → select all
- **Context Menu**: Right-click → copy/paste/delete/quantize/etc.
